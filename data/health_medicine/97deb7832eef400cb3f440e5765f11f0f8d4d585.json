They demonstrated that delivering a monoclonal antibody gene to a cell through a viral vector -- a process that bypasses the need for the host to generate a natural immune response -- provided up to 100-per-cent protection against infection in mice. The mice expressed the antibody for more than 300 days.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/gene_therapy.xml", "value": "Researchers have shown an innovative antibody delivery method could be an effective way to prevent and treat Ebola infection.
