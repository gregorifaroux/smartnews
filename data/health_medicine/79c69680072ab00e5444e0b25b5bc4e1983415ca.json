Exosomes in the bloodstream carry greatly increased amounts of heart-specific microRNAs -- as seen in both mice and humans. These exosomes preferentially go to progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Inside those cells, the microRNAs turn off a specific gene that allows the progenitor cells to leave the bone marrow and travel to the heart to attempt repairs.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/heart_disease.xml", "value": "Exosomes are key to the SOS signal that the heart muscle sends out after a heart attack.
