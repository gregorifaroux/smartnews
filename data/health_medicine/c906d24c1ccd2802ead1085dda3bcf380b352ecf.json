Prompting these memory processing systems makes it extra difficult to counter addiction because the classic stimulus-response mechanisms are reinforced by the memory effects of environmental drug cues. While this double effect makes it hard to treat drug abuse, this finding may offer a way to use cues to improve cognitive behavioural therapy.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/pharmaceuticals.xml", "value": "Besides triggering the brain's emotional and stimulus-response systems, environmental cues activate areas where memories are processed, according to this study.
