The researchers then showed that combining radiation therapy with cancer drugs designed to block DNA repair may be an effective treatment strategy.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/gene_therapy.xml", "value": "In a study of mice and human brain tumors researchers searched for new treatments by exploring the reasons why some patients with gliomas live remarkably longer than others.
