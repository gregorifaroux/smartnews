This method raises fewer practical and ethical issues than conventional systems and should prove useful for industrial applications such as testing new potential vaccines.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/health_medicine/vaccines.xml", "value": "Human norovirus is a major cause of infections that can be particularly dangerous to children and elderly people.
