The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a deal on Roku's Streaming Stick+, which is currently down to $49 at Walmart and Amazon . While not the absolute cheapest it's ever been, it's the 4K media streamer's typical discount price and a good savings from the usual going rate of $59. Walmart's deal also includes a three-month subscription to CBS' All Access streaming service, so if you've been interested in checking out Star Trek: Discovery , consider it a nice kicker.  Further Reading Roku Ultra and Streaming Stick+ review: High-end streaming with low-end frills We reviewed the Streaming Stick+ back in late 2017. To sum it up: the Streaming Stick+ lacks the Dolby Vision HDR support of Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and can't quite match the voice search capabilities of that device's built-in Alexa assistant, but it still runs well, works with HDR10, and is easy to set up. Perhaps most importantly, Roku's device interface doesn't funnel you toward certain services and programs the way Amazon or Apple tend to do. The UI could stand to get a makeover, but even if it looks bland, it stays relatively neutral in letting you use the apps you prefer to use. Unlike Roku's cheaper Premiere streamers , the Streaming Stick+ also supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi, which should keep it from buffering as much as those other devices might.  If you don't need a 4K media streamer, though, this week's Dealmaster also has a big Gold Box sale on gaming accessories at Amazon, a number of Apple device discounts, deals on Fire tablets, and more. Have a look for yourself below.  Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .
