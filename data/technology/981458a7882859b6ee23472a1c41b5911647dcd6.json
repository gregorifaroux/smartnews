The orders  seek information about the companies’ privacy policies, procedures, and practices. The orders were sent to: AT&T Inc., AT&T Mobility LLC, Comcast Cable Communications doing business as Xfinity, Google Fiber Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., and Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless.

Under current law, the FTC has the ability to enforce against unfair and deceptive practices involving Internet service providers. The FTC is seeking information from the seven companies that includes: The categories of personal information collected about consumers or their devices, including the purpose for which the information is collected or used; the techniques for collecting such information; whether the information collected is shared with third parties; internal policies for access to such data; and how long the information is retained; Whether the information is aggregated, anonymized or deidentified; Copies of the companies’ notices and disclosures to consumers about their data collection practices; Whether the companies offer consumers choices about the collection, retention, use and disclosure of personal information, and whether the companies have denied or degraded service to consumers who decline to opt-in to data collection; and Procedures and processes for allowing consumers to access, correct, or delete their personal information. The Commission is authorized to issue the Orders to File a Special Report by Section 6(b) of the FTC Act. The Commission vote to issue the orders was 5-0.
