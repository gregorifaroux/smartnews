Devin Coldewey,technology,"                        FTC tells ISPs to disclose exactly what information they collect on users and what it’s for     Devin Coldewey   @techcrunch  / 8 hours         The Federal Trade Commission, in what could be considered a prelude to new regulatory action, has issued an order to several major internet service providers requiring them to share every detail of their data collection practices. The information could expose patterns of abuse or otherwise troubling data use against which the FTC — or states — may want to take action.  The letters requesting info (detailed below) went to Comcast, Google, T-Mobile, and both the fixed and wireless sub-companies of Verizon and AT&T. These “represent a range of large and small ISPs, as well as fixed and mobile Internet providers,” an FTC spokesperson said. I’m not sure which is mean to be the small one, but welcome any information the agency can extract from any of them.  Since the Federal Communications Commission abdicated its role in enforcing consumer privacy at these ISPs when it and Congress allowed the Broadband Privacy Rule to be overturned , others have taken up the torch, notably California and even individual cities like Seattle . But for enterprises spanning the nation, national-level oversight is preferable to a patchwork approach, and so it may be that the FTC is preparing to take a stronger stance.   Everything you need to know about Congress’ decision to expose your data to internet providers   To be clear, the FTC already has consumer protection rules in place and could already go after an internet provider if it were found to be abusing the privacy of its users — you know, selling their location to anyone who asks or the like. (Still no action there, by the way.)  But the evolving media and telecom landscape, in which we see enormous companies devouring one another to best provide as many complementary services as possible, requires constant reevaluation. As the agency writes in a press release:  The FTC is initiating this study to better understand Internet service providers’ privacy practices in light of the evolution of telecommunications companies into vertically integrated platforms that also provide advertising-supported content.  Although the FTC is always extremely careful with its words, this statement gives a good idea of what they’re concerned about. If Verizon (our parent company’s parent company) wants to offer not just the connection you get on your phone, but the media you request, the ads you are served, and the tracking you never heard of, it needs to show that these businesses are not somehow shirking rules behind the scenes.  For instance, if Verizon Wireless says it doesn’t collect or share information about what sites you visit, but the mysterious VZ Snooping Co (fictitious, I should add) scoops all that up and then sells it for peanuts to its sister company, that could amount to a deceptive practice. Of course it’s rarely that simple (though don’t rule it out), but the only way to be sure is to comprehensively question everyone involved and carefully compare the answers with real-world practices.   FCC ‘looking into’ reported error throwing broadband deployment numbers off by millions   How else would we catch shady zero-rating practices, zombie cookies, backdoor deals, or lip service to existing privacy laws? It takes a lot of poring over data and complaints by the detail-oriented folks at these regulatory bodies to find things out.  To that end, the letters to ISPs ask for a whole boatload of information on companies’ data practices. Here’s a summary:   Categories of personal information collected about consumers or devices, including purposes, methods, and sources of collection  how the data has been or is being used  third parties that provide or are provided this data and what limitations are imposed thereupon  how such data is combined with other types of information and how long it is retained  internal policies and practices limiting access to this information by employees or service providers  any privacy assessments done to evaluate associated risks and policies.  how data is aggregated, anonymized, or deidentified (and how those terms are defined)  how aggregated data is used, shared, etc  “any data maps, inventories, or other charts, schematics, or graphic depictions” of information collection and storage  total number of consumers who have “visited or otherwise viewed or interacted with” the privacy policy  whether consumers are given any choice in collection and retention of data, and what the default choices are  total number and percentage of users that have exercised such a choice, and what choices they made  whether consumers are incentivized to (or threatened into) opt into data collection and how those programs work  any process for allowing consumers to “access, correct, or delete” their personal information  data deletion and retention policies for such information   Substantial, right?  Needless to say some of this information may not be particularly flattering to ISPs. If only 1 percent of consumers have ever chosen to share their information, for instance, that reflects badly on sharing it by default. And if data capable of being combined across categories or services to de-anonymize it, even potentially, that’s another major concern.  The FTC representative declined to comment on whether there would be any collaboration with the FCC on this endeavor, whether it was preliminary to any other action, and whether it can or will independently verify the information provided by the ISPs contacted. That’s an important point, considering how poorly these same companies represented their coverage data to the FCC for its yearly broadband deployment report. A reality check would be welcome.

Anti-lock brakes, traction control, torque vectoring and other bits of tech keep cars on the road instead of flying into a ditch when things get hairy. It's why newer cars typically handle corners better than older cars.            Gallery: Lamborghini Huracan EVO Spyder | 8 Photos         8                       +4                    At Lamborghini, they've taken things further with their new Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata or LDVI system. The Engine Control Unit (ECU) takes data from the entire car and uses it to adjust how the new Huracán EVO Spyder drives in real time (actually in less than 20 milliseconds. But that's about as close as you can get to real time). Cars have been doing some form of this for a while but the Italian automaker needs to be able to do this at incredible speeds and in environments your typical sedan or SUV doesn't encounter. With this technology, Lamborghini is able to take the raw power of an all-wheel-drive supercar with a V10 engine and 630 horsepower and tame it, just enough, so your average driver (who can shell out $287,400) can enjoy themselves behind the wheel of the all-wheel-steering vehicle without, you know, flying into a ditch. To achieve this, the LVDI is actually a super fast central processing unit that takes in data about the road surface, the car's setup, the tires and how the driver is driving the vehicle. It then uses that info to control various aspects of the Huracan. The system works in concert with the Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) version 2.0 hardware sensors. This system uses gyroscopes and accelerometers located at the car's center of gravity. It measures the vehicle's movements and shares that data with the LVDI computer. Lamborghini says the system is so in tune with all aspects of a drive that it can actually predict the best driving setup for the next moment. In other words, if you're behind the wheel flying around corners on a back road, the system will recognize your behavior as you enter a corner and adjust itself. ""Where it's possible to do a bigger jump in the future is with the intelligent use of four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering and the movement and control of the torque wheel by wheel in a way that can be more predictable and that is what we have with the Huracan EVO,"" said Maurizio Reggiani, chief technology officer of Automobili Lamborghini. Lamborghini is thinking about a world beyond a completely gas-powered engine though -- it has a pipeline for hybrid and electric vehicles. But Reggiani notes that Lamborghini will probably be the last automaker to leave behind a large growling power plant. Putting all that power to the ground in a controllable way requires an incredible amount of technology -- that's where LVDI and other pieces of technology come in. The automaker believes the result is a driving experience that matches exactly what the driver wants, regardless of the mode the car is in. Whether it be Strada, Sport, or the track ready Corsa, the vehicle (in a controlled way) should deliver. That control allows a driver to do something that typically takes months if not years to master: drifting. It goes against what the car wants to do -- lose traction. But in Sport mode it's possible. To do that, the vehicle has to figure out (in real time and safely) things like what angle it wants to slide. The Huracán EVO Spyder has to understand that you want to drift and not fight that. If it does, it will jerk the car (and driver) back into alignment. To relive your Fast and Furious dreams, the automaker started where lots of companies start with new technology: In the simulator. But a computer can't faithfully reproduce the real world. Mostly that has to do with tires, a variable that's tough to predict because of the density of the rubber's compound and its wear. Then, of course, there's the driver. We all drive differently but the experience must be the same for everyone. It's important that even with all that technology, it's still a driving experience. ""We don't want to have something that substitutes the driver. We want to have a car that is able to understand what the driver wants to do,"" Reggiani said. Lamborghini is known for large engines, intense growls, striking design and bank-busting prices. But the reality is all that power would be useless if drivers couldn't actually control the car. The automaker's latest system makes that possible for everyone. Sure, only a select few can own a Lamborghini, but everyone can appreciate a system that makes driving safer while simultaneously more fun.

Valentina Palladino - Mar 25, 2019 9:47 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Apple CEO Tim Cook announcing Apple News+.     reader comments  70  with 51 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Apple quietly pushed out a lengthy iOS software update today. While the day was largely dominated by Apple's ""It's Show Time"" event in which the iPhone maker announced news, gaming, and TV subscription services, it just released updates that will help users get settled with some of the new announcements.  Further Reading Apple News+: A newsstand of 300 glossy magazines for $9.99/month  Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ won't be available until the fall, so iOS 12.2's biggest updates revolve around Apple News+ . The company's new, $10-per-month news and magazine subscription service requires an update to the existing News app, which brings the UI for top articles and magazine issues chosen by Apple editors. The updated News app will also allow subscribers to read content offline and receive personalized recommendations based on topics that are most interesting to them.  iOS 12.2 also adds support for Apple's newest AirPods , which carry the new H1 chip that lets wearers call upon Siri without touching the AirPods first. The update also lets users summon Siri from iPhones or iPads to play any video, show, movie, sports game, or channel on their Apple TVs, essentially extending Siri's role on mobile devices as a virtual remote for the Apple TV.  While iOS 12.2 is full of small improvements, it likely won't make your iPhone or iPad look completely different. Today, we're also expecting updates to macOS with the release of macOS 10.14.4, but at the time of publishing this article, 10.14.4 is not available yet. We believe that update will bring Safari Autofilling using TouchID as well as dark-mode activation in Safari for sites that support a dark-mode setting.  Apple's full release notes for iOS 12.2 are as follows:  iOS 12.2 provides support for Apple News+, adds the ability for Siri to play videos from your iOS device to Apple TV, and includes four new Animoji. This update also includes bug fixes and improvements. Apple News+   Apple News+ is a new subscription service that extends the Apple News experience with hundreds of magazines and top newspapers  Our editors handpick top articles and magazine issues, and you also get personalized recommendations on the topics most interesting to you  Automatic downloads make it easy to read magazine issues offline  Apple News is now available in Canada, with a free experience that includes handpicked Top Stories, a personalized Today feed, and support for both English and French  Apple News+ is available in the U.S. and in Canada, with dozens of additional Canadian magazines   Siri   Ask Siri on your iPhone or iPad to play any video, show, movie, sports game, or channel on Apple TV. For example, ""Hey Siri, play Free Solo on my TV""   Animoji   Four new Animoji—owl, boar, giraffe and shark—are included for iPhone X and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) and iPad Pro 11-inch   AirPlay   Dedicated TV controls in Control Center and on the Lock Screen give you quick access to TV controls  AirPlay multitasking for video allows you to browse other apps, as well as play other short form audio and video files locally on your device without interrupting AirPlay  AirPlay destinations are now grouped by content type, making it faster for you to find what device you want to play to   Apple Pay   Apple Pay Cash customers can now transfer money to their bank accounts instantly using their Visa debit cards  Wallet app now conveniently displays Apple Pay credit and debit transactions right below the card   Screen Time   Downtime can be configured with a different schedule for each day of the week  A new toggle enables easily turning app limits on or off temporarily   Safari   Website sign-in now occurs automatically after filling credentials with Password AutoFill  Warnings now appear when loading unencrypted webpages  Removes support for the expired Do Not Track standard to prevent potential use as a fingerprinting variable; Intelligent Tracking Prevention now protects against cross-site tracking by default  Smart Search Field queries can now be modified by tapping the arrow icon next to search suggestions   Apple Music   The Browse tab shows more editorial highlights on a single page, making it easier to discover new music, playlists, and more   AirPods   Support for new AirPods (2nd generation)   This update also includes other improvements and bug fixes. This update:   Supports Air Quality Index in Maps for US, UK, and India  Includes information in Settings on how much time remains on your device's warranty period  Supports real-time text (RTT) for phone calls made through a nearby iPhone on iPad and iPod Touch  Displays a ""5G E"" icon for iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) or iPad Pro 11-inch indicating that users are in an area where AT&T's 5G Evolution network is available  Improves quality of audio recordings in Messages  Improves stability and performance of Apple TV Remote on iOS  Fixes an issue that prevented some missed calls from appearing in Notification Center  Addresses an issue where a badge notification could appear on Settings even though no action is needed  Addresses an issue in Settings > General > iPhone Storage where the storage size of some large apps, the System category, and the Other category in the storage bar graph could be incorrect  Fixes an issue that could cause Voice Memos to automatically play back recordings after connecting to a car Bluetooth device  Resolves an issue that could cause Voice Memos to temporarily prevent renaming a recording    Update, 6:53pm ET: MacOS 10.14.4 is now available as a software update. The update brings Dark Mode to Safari websites that support a dark-mode setting, as well as numerous changes to support the new Apple News+ service. Full release notes can be found on Apple's support site.                reader comments  70  with 51 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Valentina Palladino Valentina reviews consumer electronics for Ars Technica, testing all kinds of gadgets with a focus on mobile devices and wearables.

The news follows Spotify’s recent acquisitions of Gimlet Media, another reputable podcast network, and Anchor, a podcast creation app. In its press release about the purchase, Spotify says that crime and mystery podcasts are “a top genre for our users,” and that’s why it felt Parcast was worth buying.  Given this, it makes sense that Spotify would want to invest in a network that already has the expertise to create intriguing shows. Spotify’s CFO Barry McCarthy has said the company is similarly modeled after Netflix in that it’ll develop “good, predictive algorithms,” so Spotify knows what people like and can greenlight production based off those forecasts.  In this case, Spotify didn’t need a sophisticated algorithm to tell it something; it had listening data to help make its purchasing decision. The company has previously referred to its purchase of Gimlet as akin to Disney buying Pixar or Marvel — the studios retain their independence but live within, and richen, their corporate parent’s intellectual property library. Parcast hasn’t clarified whether it’ll maintain its team or offices, but Gimlet is keeping its Brooklyn, New York headquarters. Since the Gimlet deal’s announcement, the Gimlet creative team made its plans to unionize known, although Gimlet and its legal counsel said they won’t voluntarily recognize the union.  Spotify said it plans to spend up to $500 million on podcast-related deals, so the company will likely have more news later this year.

We’re going to be discussing much bigger spoilers below , so you might want to avoid reading further.  If you have seen Us , you probably remember “Ophelia,” the Amazon Alexa-like voice assistant that plays a key role in one of the film’s most darkly funny scenes. Ophelia is good at playing music, but not great at interpreting commands — which becomes a problem when a character frantically tells Ophelia to call the police, only to discover that Ophelia has misheard an order to play N.W.A.’s “Fuck Tha Police” instead.  Smart speakers — even ones that let people make phone calls — generally don’t support 911  The Ophelia speaker helps establish its owners, the mostly unsympathetic Tylers, as a yuppie family with a penchant for useless high-tech toys. In Us , the joke is that Ophelia can’t understand the Tylers’ requests or the fact that they’re fighting for their lives against a group of doppelgängers. If it worked like the Echo or Google Home, though, Ophelia would have been useless even if it understood the request perfectly. Most smart speakers can’t call the police, and there’s been a long debate over whether they should.  Smart speakers — even ones that let people make phone calls — generally don’t support emergency or 911 calling for technical and regulatory reasons. As The Wall Street Journal explained last year, devices like Alexa and Google Home don’t offer the same location details as a mobile or landline phone, making it harder to route and respond to emergency calls. They also generally don’t have their own callback numbers, and their manufacturers don’t pay the monthly 911 surcharge that’s tacked onto ordinary phone bills. (Services like Skype usually can’t place emergency calls for the same reasons.)  There’s huge promise in a system that lets people dial emergency numbers when they can’t reach a phone — especially for people with mobility issues. But adding 911 service would require clearing some FCC hurdles, and the Journal wrote that spotty internet service could make the service unreliable. Most people already have phones, and in many cases, they’re better off using a system that’s known to work than experimenting with something new.  Smart speakers also raise serious privacy concerns. They collect huge amounts of data that can be requisitioned by law enforcement — late last year, a New Hampshire judge ordered Amazon to turn over Echo recordings related to a double murder case. Amazon has also sent one user’s Echo voice recordings to someone else , and the Echo has recorded private conversations after being accidentally activated. Wired has speculated that smart speakers could end up being subject to “mission creep” if they’re linked to emergency services, expanding from simple 911 calls to preemptively detecting dangerous situations.  Smart speakers can tell you the numbers for intimate partner violence or suicide hotlines, even if they can’t directly make a call  For now, though, that particular concern seems far away. It’s true that in at least one incident, Albuquerque police publicly thanked Alexa for calling emergency services. But experts said this would have required an unusual and convoluted series of events, and the police admitted that they weren’t sure exactly what had transpired.  There are some exceptions and workarounds. The Amazon Echo Connect specifically hooks into a landline and acts as a voice-controlled speakerphone system. Alexa skills like “Ask My Buddy” can let you alert a friend who can call 911 for you. Siri can dial emergency services on the iPhone — sometimes a bit too easily, as many people who have accidentally told it to dial an  emergency number found out. And smart speakers can tell you the numbers for intimate partner violence or suicide hotlines, even if they can’t directly make a call.  “Ophelia” isn’t Alexa — maybe because using a real smart speaker in an unflattering light could create legal hassle, or maybe because it would have felt too much like splicing an Amazon commercial into the middle of the movie. And in fairness, when I asked an Echo to call the police last night, it just looked for a (nonexistent) phone contact called “Police” instead of blasting “Straight Outta Compton.”  But Ophelia mirrors the false sense of security that real smart speakers can provide, just as horror films often play on our concerns about modern technology. In the Albuquerque incident above, a recording apparently did capture someone asking Alexa to call 911. It’s just that Alexa, as far as we know, wasn’t in a position to help.

Sean Gallagher - Mar 26, 2019 12:01 pm UTC         Enlarge Aurich Lawson / Getty     reader comments  104  with 59 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      People who find security vulnerabilities commonly run into difficulties when reporting them to the responsible company. But it's less common for such situations to turn into tense trade-show confrontations—and competing claims of assault and blackmail.  Yet that's what happened when executives at Atrient—a casino technology firm headquartered in West Bloomfield, Michigan—stopped responding to two UK-based security researchers who had reported some alleged security flaws. The researchers thought they had reached an agreement regarding payment for their work, but nothing final ever materialized. On February 5, 2019, one of the researchers—Dylan Wheeler, a 23-year-old Australian living in the UK—stopped by Atrient's booth at a London conference to confront the company’s chief operating officer.  What happened next is in dispute. Wheeler says that Atrient COO Jessie Gill got in a confrontation with him and yanked off his conference lanyard; Gill insists he did no such thing, and he accused Wheeler of attempted extortion.  The debacle culminated in legal threats and a lot of mudslinging, with live play-by-play commentary as it played out on Twitter. Rapid7 Director of Research Tod Beardsley was one of the spectators. ""My first reaction,"" Beardsley joked, ""was, man, I wish a vendor would punch me for disclosure. Boy, that beats any bug bounty.""   Vulnerability Disclosure Bingo. From https://t.co/6jvhEvksOe  pic.twitter.com/aL0avgSrzq  — @mikko (@mikko) February 15, 2019  The story is practically a case study in the problems that can arise with vulnerability research and disclosure.  Many large companies and technology vendors now run active ""bug bounty"" programs to channel the efforts of outside hackers and security researchers toward productively uncovering security problems in their software and infrastructure—but the vast majority of companies have no clear mechanism for outsiders to share information about security gaps.  When it comes to disclosing vulnerabilities to those types of companies, Beardsley told Ars, ""I've gotten everything ranging from silence to active ignorance—'I don't wanna hear it'—to  cease and desist letters telling me 'I'll take down your advisory.' All of that, and I've gotten lots of good [responses], too. I've dealt with people who have not had a long track record with disclosure and I hand hold them through it.""  In this case, two relatively inexperienced ""ethical hackers"" tried to feel their way through what they felt was a fairly serious security problem, even as Atrient executives felt like they were being taken for a ride by unscrupulous hackers trying to make a buck. Thanks to call recordings and a months-long e-mail thread between Wheeler, Atrient, and other stakeholders in the disclosure—including a major US casino operator and the FBI's Cyber Division—we have a pretty good idea of how the situation played out.  The company         Atrient's Las Vegas office, just a stone's throw from McCarran International Airport.   Google          Atrient's headquarters is in this building in West Bloomfield, Michigan.   Google       Atrient is a small company, plying its wares in a highly specific niche of the casino and gaming industry.  Originally founded in April of 2002 by Sam Attisha and Jashinder (Jessie) Gill as Vistron, Inc. and renamed a year later, according to Michigan corporate records, Atrient was initially a catch-all technology consulting company. It offered ""solutions outside the box"" (as the company’s original website described them) related to IT staffing, software development, creative services, and project management. The company briefly took a stab at the wireless business, operating Vistron Wireless Inc. to ""provide marketing and technology services to the wireless industry,"" according to corporate registration documents.  Within a few years, Atrient's work grew to include software integration for casinos. By 2015, Atrient’s main focus became a casino customer loyalty system called PowerKiosk, which connects freestanding kiosks, electronic slot machines, and mobile applications to track casino gamblers and present them with rewards, special games and marketing offers. The system can track customers through loyalty cards that it issues or through Bluetooth ""beacons"" and geolocation using mobile applications, as well as tracking the value of a person's rewards points accumulated by activities within the casino.  While Atrient maintains an office in Las Vegas for sales and customer support, the company's headquarters are in a small office and retail building in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Atrient's headquarters shares the second floor of the building with a dentist and an H&R Block Advisors office, with a Tim Horton’s donut shop and a mattress store below. (Atrient shares its office with Azilen , an IT outsourcing company with two offices in India and one in Belgium. The full relationship between Azilen and Atrient isn't clear; at least one Azilen developer now works for Atrient's subsidiary in Hyderabad, India, which was registered in May of 2018.)  Atrient has apparently done well in its niche, partnering with a number of major players in the casino and gaming industry. Konami cut a deal in 2014 for exclusive distribution rights to Atrient's software for existing Konami customers. Atrient has also integrated its software with gaming systems from Scientific Games' Bally Technology unit and International Game Technology.  Over the past year or more, Atrient was in negotiations with the gaming and financial tech company Everi Holdings—negotiations that culminated on March 12, 2019 with the announced acquisition of ""certain assets and intellectual property"" of Atrient by Everi. The $40 million deal was done with $20 million in cash, with additional payouts based on contingencies in the agreement over the next two years. These negotiations were ongoing as the researchers tried to make their security concerns heard.

Sarah Perez,technology,"                        Wayfair to open its first brick-and-mortar store this fall     Sarah Perez   @sarahintampa  / 10 hours         Another major e-commerce brand its expanding its business offline. Wayfair, the Boston-based online furniture retailer whose net revenue topped $2 billion in the fourth quarter , announced this morning it plans to open its first full-service retail store this fall. The store, which will be based in Natick, Mass., will connect the company’s online business to the real world, allowing customers to meet with home design experts, try out the furniture in person and order home delivery of both in-store products and those from Wayfair’s website.  The company had previously operated pop-up shops in Natick, Mass. and Paramus, N.J., and it recently opened an outlet connected to its Florence, Ky. warehouse. However, these are not equivalent to the store it now has planned. But Wayfair will open four other pop-ups this summer, at yet to be announced locations, that will offer curated selections of merchandise.  The larger retail store will be located in the Natick Mall in Natick, Mass. — the same place where Wayfair ran its holiday 2018 pop-up.  Like most other furniture retailers, the new store will offer customers design assistance through complimentary consultations, where the experts may suggest recommendations ranging from home improvement projects to décor selections.  The shoppers will be able to order from the store’s product inventory, or from Wayfair’s website for home delivery.  It’s not unusual these days to see e-commerce brands pursuing an omnichannel experience, where their online site overlaps with a brick-and-mortar presence. Amazon, notably, has recently pursued this path through its Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon Books stores and Amazon Go convenience stores. Walmart and Target and other big-box retailers offer a variety of ways to shop online, pick up at the store or order home delivery with help from in-store associates.  Other e-commerce-first brands — particularly in the fashion and beauty space — also today often launch physical retail stores as a means of attracting new customers who hadn’t yet shopped their site, as well as catering to current customers through a new channel.  For example, Rent the Runway , The RealReal , Glossier , ThredUp , Allbirds, Away, ModCloth, Madison Reed and others have joined older brands like Warby Parker, Zappos and Bonobos in expanding their operations to include brick-and-mortar footprints.  While physical retail increases overhead, it does send a message to shoppers that the company is more stable than some other fly-by-night brands found only through Instagram and Facebook ads.  It also offers a way for customers to physically inspect merchandise they may not feel comfortable buying online — like clothes that require trying on for fit, makeup they want to test or — in the case of Wayfair’s furniture — a way to touch and feel the fabrics, closely inspect the build quality and visualize items alongside other design materials like fabric swatches or paint strips, for example.  “With the opening of our new retail store, we are offering our customers a new way to enjoy Wayfair’s exceptional shopping experience as we continue to transform the way people shop for their homes,” said Niraj Shah, CEO, co-founder and co-chairman, Wayfair, in a statement. “We look forward to inviting our customers further into the world of Wayfair, welcoming them to step inside our newest shopping experience guided by the knowledgeable support and expertise of our in-store design team,” Shah added.  The news comes just after Wayfair posted its biggest year-over-year revenue growth (40 percent) to date in a better than expected Q4 2018. The company also saw its active customer base jump 38 percent to 15.2 million, and orders per customer jump to 1.85 versus 1.77 in the year ago period. However, the retailer reported growing losses attributed to operating expenses, including marketing and advertising, and hiring — factors that have had some questioning the sustainability of Wayfair’s growth.  One single retail store won’t necessarily take the pressure off Wayfair’s high operating expenses , but it allows the retailer to experiment with a more traditional model and measure its impacts.  Wayfair didn’t offer an exact launch date beyond “fall 2019” or other details about the stores, like square footage, for example. It said other details will be shared closer to launch.                        ","Another major e-commerce brand its expanding its business offline.

Dave Bailey,technology,"Homepage Homepage Sign in Get started The Founder Coach Product Marketing Fundraising Leadership CEO Coaching How to Deliver Constructive Feedback in Difficult Situations Dave Bailey Blocked Unblock Follow Following Mar 26 “We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel,”― Marshall B. Rosenberg, Nonviolent Communication All my biggest regrets as a founder are around not having difficult conversations sooner. I could have helped team members improve faster, fired people with the wrong fit earlier, had so many more productive meetings. I could have created a more open company culture. I was guilty of making excuses: ‘It will sort itself out.’; ‘They’ll eventually stop doing it.’; ‘There are more important things to focus on.’ Of course, delaying these conversations always made things worse. And, sometimes, it even led to crises. The Side-Effect of Empathy Empathy means tuning in to the feelings of others. Like many founders, I’ve always had a lot of empathy for people — after all, founders focus their lives on understanding the feelings and needs of their customers. But when it comes to difficult conversations, I’ve found that empathy has a side-effect. I can get so focused on how the conversation might affect the other person’s feelings that I lose sight of why the conversation is needed in the first place. Without a healthy amount of ‘self-empathy’, we often find that our own needs, and the needs of the business, take the passenger’s seat. Nonviolent Communication Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is an awful name for one of the most powerful communication courses I’ve ever taken. NVC helps you to be honest, without criticising, insulting, or putting down other people. At the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern: When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because I’m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]? At first glance, this looks easy. But in practice, it’s extremely difficult to pull off. To grasp the complexity, NVC makes some subtle but critical distinctions: Observations vs. evaluations Emotions vs. thoughts Universal needs vs. strategies Requests vs. demands Understanding these nuances is key to handling difficult conversations. Let’s go through each one. 1. Observations vs. evaluations ‘The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.’ — Jiddu Krishnamurti, Indian Philosopher An observation is something that you actually saw or heard in the past. You can think of it as raw information. The majority of observations fall into two categories: (i) what you heard, e.g., direct quotes, and (ii) what you saw, e.g., visible past behaviours. Our brains are hardwired to take raw information and instantly make up a simple story — good or bad, right or wrong, hero or villain. These stories are evaluations and they are very hard to separate from observations. Here are a few examples to illustrate the difference: Evaluation: ‘You are lazy.’ (a character attack) Observation: ‘You said that you’d send the document last week and I haven’t received it.’ Evaluation: ‘Your work is sloppy.’ (a criticism) Observation: ‘Three of the numbers in the report were inaccurate.’ Evaluation: ‘You’re always late.’ (a generalisation) Observation: ‘You arrived ten minutes late to the meeting this morning.’ Evaluation: You ignored me.’ (implied intent) Observation: ‘I sent you two emails and I haven’t received a response.’ An easy way to check whether you’ve made an observation or an evaluation is to ask yourself, ‘What did I actually see or hear?’ 2. Emotions vs. thoughts The usual reaction to talking about feelings is, ‘Oh God, really?’ But being aware of, and communicating, our emotions has a powerful impact on other people. When a difficult conversation is needed, people often say they feel: Scared Annoyed Anxious Confused Embarrassed Hurt Sad Tired These words are important because often, what comes after ‘I feel,’ isn’t an emotion — it’s a thought. Compare the following examples: Thought: ‘I feel that you aren’t taking this seriously.’ Emotion: ‘I feel frustrated.’ If you can substitute ‘I feel’ with ‘I think’ and the phrase still works, it’s a thought, not an emotion. And sharing our thoughts in difficult conversations can often get us into trouble, especially if the other person disagrees and wants to correct you. There are a few emotions that require extra attention and curiosity before sharing them: a) Anger: Anger often masks more painful emotions like hurt and shame. It’s important to figure out what’s underneath the anger before having a difficult conversation, because when you’re angry, you’re more likely to speak impulsively and forget NVC altogether. b) Evaluative words: Consider the phrase, ‘I feel blamed’. Doesn’t it sound a lot like the evaluation, ‘You blamed me’? To reduce the chance of a defensive response like, ‘I didn’t blame you’, NVC asks that you identify the evaluation and recognise how it impacts you emotionally. For example, feeling ‘blamed’ might leave you feeling ‘scared’. Here are some others: Evaluation: ‘I feel judged.’ Impact: ‘I feel resentful.’ Evaluation: ‘I feel misunderstood.’ Impact: ‘I feel frustrated.’ Evaluation: ‘I feel rejected.’ Impact: ‘I feel hurt.’ At this stage of the course, I began to realise how bad my emotional literacy was — I found it pretty hard to get past ‘upset’ and ‘pissed off’. 3. Universal Needs vs. Strategies NVC asserts that all human beings share the same universal needs and that behind every negative emotion lies an unmet universal needs. For example, if a certain comment in a meeting left you feeling embarrassed, you might realise that you felt embarrassed because your need for consideration wasn’t being met. The pairing of emotions with universal needs has a transformative effect in difficult conversations. Common universal needs that come up a lot in difficult conversations are: Autonomy Collaboration Consistency Clarity Integrity Recognition Respect Reassurance Security Support Understanding Not everything that follows the words, ‘I need’ is a universal need. You can say, ‘I need a sandwich,’ but that doesn’t mean sandwiches are a universal need. NVC distinguishes between our universal needs and the strategies that would meet our needs. Eating a sandwich is a strategy to meet your need for hunger. Here’s another example: Strategy: ‘I need you to copy me into every email.’ Universal need: ‘I need some transparency.’ There’s a subtle but important point to make here. As soon as you include ‘from you’ in the need statement, it stops being universal. Compare the following statements: Strategy: ‘I need support from you.’ Universal need: ‘I need support.’ Can you see how the first version could be more easily interpreted as a veiled accusation? ‘You aren’t supporting me,’ is the implication. To minimise the chance of defensiveness, NVC tells us to leave other people out of our needs. Identifying my universal needs had a powerful effect on me. Once you uncover the universal need, it’s much easier to identify new strategies that meet everyone’s universal needs. 4. Requests vs. Demands What is the difference between a request and a demand? Both are strategies that would meet an unmet need. But unlike demands, requests are invitations for the other person to meet our needs . . . but only if it isn’t in conflict with one of their needs. There are three principles that can help you make clear requests: a) Make it specific. ‘I request that you be more respectful,’ is vague — what signals respect to you may not signal respect to someone else. Spell out the concrete behaviours that would meet your need for respect: ‘I request that you arrive at meetings on time.’ b) Say what you want, not what you don’t want. ‘I request that you don’t dismiss other people’s ideas straightaway,’ explains what you don’t want, but it doesn’t spell out what you do want. Take time to clarify the behaviours you want to see. For example: ‘I request that when a team member shares an idea, you ask two or three probing questions before sharing your conclusion.’ c) Stay curious. There are many ways to satisfy your underlying needs, but is there a way of satisfying everybody’s needs? To maximise the chance of having your needs met, treat ‘no’ as an invitation to explore the needs stopping someone from saying ‘yes’. Remember, great communication isn’t just about what you say, it’s about what other people hear. Even something as simple as, ‘I’d like you to be on time for the next meeting,’ can have an unintended meaning, depending on the context. Don’t be afraid to check in and ask someone to recap what they heard. You don’t want to patronise them, so be diplomatic and politely ask, ‘Just so we know we’re on the same page, could you play back what I’m asking of you?’ The 40-Word Rule During difficult conversations, it’s important to be extremely concise. Aim to describe your observations, feelings, needs and requests in less than 40 words. Using more words suggests you’re justifying your needs, and this decreases their power. It’s also worth noting the importance of having these conversations face-to-face. NVC loses some of its power when it’s in an email. Here are some examples of the kind of feedback needed in startups. To a co-founder: ‘When you said, “I’m not happy with your work,” to me in front of the team, I felt embarrassed because it didn’t meet my need for trust and recognition. Please, could we set up a weekly one-on-one session to share feedback in private?’ To an investor: ‘I haven’t received any responses from the last three monthly updates. I’m feeling concerned because I need input. Please, would you mind getting back to me with responses to my questions in the last update?’ To a teammate: ‘You arrived 10 minutes late to the last three team meetings. I am frustrated because, as a team, we have a need for efficiency. Please, could you help me understand what’s happening?’ All this preparation for 30–40 words may sound like a lot of work. It is a lot of work. But the result is clear, concise and powerful. No naming and shaming. No waffling. Just clarity about what you’ve observed, how you feel about it, and what needs are not being met. And at the end, you have a clear, actionable request. How to React When your Request is Met with ‘No’ You’ve said your piece and made a request. In a perfect world, the other person would say, ‘Yes, of course.’ However, even the most careful feedback can be met with defensiveness and hostility. How should you respond? Just as you figured out your feelings and needs before the difficult conversation, hearing a ‘no’ is your chance to empathise with the other person. How is the other person feeling? And what unmet needs are stopping them from saying ‘yes’? This is the hardest part of all: to see past their evaluations, thoughts and strategies, and stay focused on clarifying their underlying needs. In conflict, empathy is more effective than insisting or convincing. ‘Empathy is the gift of hearing someone without taking it personally,’—Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication To empathise, ask questions that aim to clarify the other person’s feelings and needs: Are you feeling hurt because you need some understanding? Are you feeling angry because you need your hard work to be recognised? Is there more you’d like to say? You don’t have to get it right — you just have to be curious. Silence is often more powerful than words, and when you uncover the needs that stop someone from saying ‘yes’, you’re much closer to finding a strategy that meets everyone’s needs. Similarly, if you’re on the receiving end of a request and have to say ‘no’, state the underlying need that stops you from saying ‘yes’. Boundaries and Consequences The outcome of a difficult conversation isn’t necessarily an agreement. We hope that we can get our needs met, but sometimes this isn’t possible. The sad truth is that no one can meet our needs all of the time. Ultimately, the responsibility of meeting our needs is our own. So we need to set boundaries and outline the consequences of crossing those boundaries. Outlining consequences is one of the most uncomfortable parts of being a manager, especially for people that want to be liked. What if the other person thinks we’re being unfair? Keep in mind that appropriate consequences are those whose purpose is to protect your needs, not to punish the other person. In other words, consequences should be protective, not punitive. Let’s say an employee continually misses their sales quotas. As a manager, you are responsible for the effectiveness of your team — and every team needs effectiveness. If deadlines continue to be missed (the boundary), you might have to switch their responsibilities or move them on (the consequence). It’s not personal, it’s just what you’ll do to protect your need for effectiveness. Compassionate Leadership The art of compassionate leadership is in being able to empathise with others while also empathising with yourself. This helps you to communicate more directly, and to better manage healthy conflict. It can even make you a better designer, marketer, and salesperson. I still feel vulnerable when exposing my emotions. It still takes time to identify what I need. And it’s still easier to identify what I don’t want than what I do want. But I’m persevering, and it’s having a massive impact on my relationships, by making difficult conversations just that little bit easier.

Drew Angerer / Getty Images     Another week, another Facebook privacy disaster.  This time, it turns out Facebook was storing the personal passwords for hundreds of millions of Facebook users unencrypted on the company servers, according to a report from the security publication Krebs on Security . That means these passwords were readable to thousands of Facebook employees, an obvious and concerning security risk.  Facebook confirmed that, yes, this was indeed the case, and Facebook discovered it in January during a “routine security review.” The company usually encrypts passwords so they aren’t viewable to hackers or other people who might have access to the servers where they are stored.  “To be clear, these passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them,” the company wrote in a blog post .  Facebook says the issue has been resolved and it will alert “hundreds of millions” of people whose passwords were visible. Krebs on Security reported that the number of visible passwords belonged to between 200 million and 600 million users.  The misstep is just the latest for Facebook, which has played fast and loose with user privacy and data collection practices for years. Some of the company’s old policies allowed outside developers to collect Facebook user data, often without the users understanding what was happening — and in the case of Cambridge Analytica, that data was also sold outside of Facebook to a political data firm.  Numerous software bugs  led to Facebook privacy issues in 2018, and, last September, hackers stole the profile information for tens of millions of Facebook users .  Now Facebook is under investigation from multiple government agencies, including the FTC, and could face a considerable fine for its role in the Cambridge Analytica issue . It seems likely this password situation will provide regulators with yet another arrow they’ll use to try and regulate the company’s data and privacy practices.  Facebook, meanwhile, has lost the benefit of the doubt with a lot of users and regulators.  “There is nothing more important to us than protecting people’s information,” Facebook wrote on its blog.

By  Kurt Wagner and Theodore Schleifer    Mar 22, 2019,  5:41pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Pinterest is growing, but not as fast as Twitter or Snap were when they filed their IPOs      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann.  John Lamparski/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York     Pinterest’s business is growing steadily, but not at the same clip as other big advertising - driven tech IPOs from the past decade. According to new IPO paperwork filed Friday that offered the most detailed look yet at Pinterest’s business, Facebook, Twitter, and Snap were all showing faster pre-IPO growth.  Pinterest reported revenue of roughly $756 million in 2018, growth of 59 percent from the year before. Pinterest’s 2017 revenue of roughly $473 million also represented 58 percent growth over the year prior.  That’s not bad, but it’s also not the kind of hyper growth we’ve seen from other advertising-driven tech businesses at the time of IPO. Pinterest is not just a social network or a communication business, but it is a consumer app that makes all of its money from advertising. That means it competes for ad dollars with places like Facebook, Twitter, and Snap, so it’s no surprise Pinterest also listed all three companies as competitors in its S-1 paperwork.  Twitter’s business nearly tripled in the full year before its IPO, and Facebook’s nearly doubled. Snap’s business, meanwhile, grew by almost 600 percent in the year before it filed IPO paperwork.  How big were these advertising businesses the full year before their respective IPOs?   Twitter — $317 million in 2012, growth of 198 percent  Facebook — $3.7 billion in 2011, growth of 88 percent  Snap — $404.5 million in 2017, growth of 597 percent over the previous year   In both Twitter and Snap’s case, the businesses were smaller than Pinterest’s is. But that kind of crazy year-over-year growth also gave a sense that they were far from slowing down. (We would learn later — in both cases — that wasn’t actually true.)  Pinterest, though, has shown some steady revenue growth, which may not be as sexy as the classic Silicon Valley hockey-stick growth, but it may prove more reliable.  Net losses have been decreasing over the last three years, but the company is still not profitable. The picture, though, is improving: Losses came in at $60 million in 2018, about a third of its losses from three years ago.  Pinterest is also using a controversial, even if increasingly common, dual-class stock structure that will allow its founders to maintain control even as it transitions to a public company. To defenders, that set-up helps insulate a company from unruly activist investors and protects a founder’s long-term vision. To critics, that can lead to unaccountability and can therefore dissuade investors from buying shares.  Existing shareholders in Pinterest will hold Class B stock, which will have 20 times as much voting power as those who are new to the company. That’s a huge discrepancy. It’s the same uneven ratio that an expert called “pretty egregious” when it was unsealed at Lyft, but a key difference here is that it’s not just the company’s co-founders that will hold the special stock, but all shareholders.  Perhaps the biggest question about Pinterest over the years has been: What is it? Is it a commerce company? Is it a search company? Is it a social company? The distinction matters because it gives people a point of reference in valuing the business. Pinterest, for example, has pushed back on the idea that it’s a social company , perhaps in part to avoid comparisons to Facebook, the same comparisons that have been troubling for Twitter and Snapchat. (Though as consumer apps predominantly relying on advertising revenue, some comparisons are warranted.)  But understanding what Pinterest is also helps set expectations around what Pinterest will build and who they’ll work with. Today, Pinterest describes itself as a “visual search” company, where the main business pitch to potential advertisers is that people visit the site for inspiration. If you’re planning a wedding or a home remodel, then Pinterest might be a great tool for you — and what better time for advertisers to reach a potential customer than when they are considering a major life change?  Another challenge Pinterest has confronted is the belief that the company is overvalued. The company notched close to its current valuation at one of the frothiest times in venture capital: in 2015 at about $10 billion. But Pinterest’s valuation barely jumped between 2015 and 2017, lending credence to the idea that the market found Pinterest as not quite earning its mega-valuation — last measured at about $12 billion two years ago.  But if there’s any good time for a startup to file and try and avoid a downround IPO, it’s now. The IPO market of 2019 is expected to be the busiest in at least a decade, with listings en route from Uber, Lyft, and Slack. Amid worries that a recession could arrive in late 2019 or early 2020, some bankers and other IPO advisers have been encouraging clients to accelerate listing plans to avoid a broader stock sell-off.  Pinterest was initially targeting an IPO closer to the middle of the year, but appears to be heeding advice to move quickly.  Major shareholders include Bessemer Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and FirstMark Capital, each of which own more than 5 percent of the company. The filing didn’t disclose the ownership percentage of Ben Silbermann, the company’s CEO.

Eric Berger - Mar 26, 2019 1:23 pm UTC         Enlarge  / NASA astronaut Anne McClain needs to use a smaller spacesuit. NASA     reader comments  162  with 85 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      NASA announced on Monday afternoon that it had canceled a plan to have astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch perform the agency's first all-female spacewalk on Friday. The decision follows McClain's first spacewalk outside the International Space Station, which occurred last Friday, March 22.  ""Mission managers decided to adjust the assignments, due in part to spacesuit availability on the station,"" the space agency said . ""McClain learned during her first spacewalk that a medium-size hard upper torso—essentially the shirt of the spacesuit—fits her best. Because only one medium-size torso can be made ready by Friday, March 29, Koch will wear it.""  Astronaut Nick Hague will suit up along with Koch this Friday to replace a set of batteries outside the station that store solar power for use when the station is in the Earth's shadow. This decision to replace McClain with Hague has raised a number of questions, including some conspiracy theories that NASA is incompetent or misogynistic. Neither of these is true, although the space agency does have a problem with its spacesuit inventory and future procurement plans. Let's dig into some of the questions raised here.  Why was the EVA really canceled?  It really was a ""fit"" issue in regard to spacesuits. After her EVA (extravehicular activity) last Friday in a ""large"" spacesuit, McClain realized she would be better able to work in a suit with a medium-sized torso. The torso is a fiber-glass shell, and if it is not snug it is difficult to maneuver the suit and reach control dials on the front. (Spacesuits sometimes fit differently in microgravity than in ground tests).  Further Reading Swimming with spacemen: training for spacewalks at NASA’s giant pool  NASA has four spacesuits on the International Space Station, according to Jacklyn Kagey, lead officer for the upcoming spacewalk. Two of those suits are medium-sized, but only one is presently configured for a spacewalk (making the second one ready would require about 12 hours of work). Since Koch also uses a medium-sized suit, NASA planners decided the safest decision was to have Koch proceed in the medium suit and Hague participate in a larger suit.  Is NASA telling the truth?  Yes. I have reported on NASA to a greater or lesser extent for nearly two decades, including the space shuttle Columbia accident. In these kinds of circumstances, I have rarely found that NASA officials have lied or even shaded the truth. For the most part, we are dealing with engineers here, and they're constantly making trades on what is the most expedient and safest solution to whatever problem they're facing.  During a briefing to preview NASA's upcoming spacewalk, station Mission Operations Integration Manager Kenny Todd explained that NASA did not make a deliberate decision to have two women conduct an EVA for the first time. ""There was a lot of circumstances that got us here,"" he said. Among those circumstances was the fact that NASA had two women on orbit who were capable of fulfilling demanding EVA tasks. There are also scheduling issues—NASA has a series of spacewalks it wants to get completed now, in the lull between the recent visit from the Crew Dragon spacecraft and upcoming supply missions in April.  Further Reading SpaceX completes a historic mission, crew flight possible later in 2019  Todd recalled a scheduling discussion late in 2018 with astronaut Kate Rubins, who heads the EVA branch of the crew office. They were planning these EVAs and assessing who would be available to conduct them.  ""I don't know if it was Kate or I that kind of asked, 'Have we ever sent two women out before?'"" Todd recalled. ""Again it just wasn't something that jumped out at us because it all starts here with competence and abilities, regardless if someone is male or female. That's got to be the core of how we start something. There's nothing about this that's put together to make it look like a certain thing.""  How hard are EVAs?  Spacewalks are physically demanding. They are dangerous due to the potential for micrometeoroid impacts and also because spacesuit problems regularly occur—there has been about one suit issue for every 10 EVAs that NASA has performed. Enlarge  / On March 22, Anne McClain works on the International Space Station's Port-4 truss structure during a 6-hour, 39-minute spacewalk. NASA  Frankly, if McClain was uncomfortable in a large spacesuit, she (and NASA) made the correct call here. Former astronaut John Grunsfeld described the physical toll of moving a bulky spacesuit (even in microgravity) around for 6.5 hours, and performing various tasks, as akin to running a marathon. Adding risk due to an overly large spacesuit would be foolish.  What about NASA's spacesuit problem?  NASA does have a spacesuit problem. A 2017 report by the agency's inspector general catalogued some of these issues. Notably, the agency's current stock of spacesuits were designed in 1974 and were first flown in 1981. ""Designed for the Space Shuttle Program, each EMU has been partially redesigned and completely refurbished multiple times over the last 40 years,"" the report stated.  Further Reading NASA inspector says agency wasted $80 million on an inferior spacesuit  Of the 18 spacesuits originally produced, 11 remain in service. Those suits are rotated up to the station, and down, and are serviced on the ground. NASA performs maintenance on each suit after six years on the station, or 25 EVAs, whichever comes first. ""We have a sustaining plan that gets us out through the remainder of the program with these particular suits,"" Todd said.  The 2017 report criticized the agency's efforts to develop a ""next generation"" of spacesuits that would be needed for activities at the Lunar Gateway, in orbit around the Moon, on the Moon, or on Mars. Part of the problem is that the destination for NASA's crewed programs has changed at least three times since 2005, and there have also been issues with stewardship. As a result, the report found, ""The agency remains years away from having a flight-ready spacesuit ... suitable for use on future exploration missions.""  Does NASA discriminate against female astronauts?  To the best of our understanding and knowledge, the answer to this is no. Back during the Apollo program, and even during the early part of the space shuttle program, there certainly were issues with diversity at the space agency, and especially among its astronaut corps.  Further Reading Netflix film examines why NASA shunned women astronauts in early days  NASA has taken significant steps since then. The space agency has flown 45 women into space, and nine of the 20 astronaut candidates in the last two astronaut classes (2013 and 2017) were women. More than that, women have begun to take prominent roles in spaceflight. The home of NASA's astronaut corps, the Johnson Space Center, was directed by former astronaut Ellen Ochoa from 2012 to 2018.  And in 2017, Peggy Whitson , who has flown into space three times, broke the record for most time spent in space by a US astronaut with a cumulative total of 665 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station. Today, the women aren't just flying at NASA—they're helping to lead the space agency. Hopefully, we will soon reach the point where an all-female EVA does not register as newsworthy at all.                 reader comments  162  with 85 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Eric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA.

By  Rani Molla @ranimolla    Mar 25, 2019,  8:17am EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  American consumers spent more on Airbnb than on Hilton last year      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Much of Airbnb’s growth is coming from travelers who live in the central US.  Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Wired25     Airbnb has long felt like an existential threat to hotel companies. New data shows that it actually is one.  US consumers spent more money on Airbnb last year than they did on Hilton and its subsidiary brands like DoubleTree and Embassy Suites, according to new data from Second Measure , a company that analyzes billions of dollars in anonymized debit and credit card purchases. Their Airbnb spending is even catching up to Marriott, the world’s largest hotel company , which added to its revenue by acquiring Starwood hotels in 2016.  The data shows roughly 30 percent growth last year in US consumer spending on Airbnb, which is expected to go public next year and is currently valued at about $38 billion .  Much of that growth, according to Second Measure, is coming from travelers who live in the central US. Currently, about a third of Airbnb’s US customers are from populous coastal states like California, New York, and Florida. That’s a departure from 2012, when people from those states made up half its customers.       This growth comes as Airbnb, which has traditionally been a way for people to rent space in their homes, branches out more directly into the hotel space. Last year, the company expanded its bookings to include boutique hotels . Earlier this month, Airbnb acquired the last-minute hotel booking site HotelTonight , bringing it even deeper into the mainstream hotel market.  Indeed, hotels, which have long lobbied against Airbnb, are increasingly competing for the same customers. Twelve percent of major hotel* customers also booked with Airbnb last year, up from 1 percent in 2013, according to Second Measure.  Out of all US consumer lodging spending last year, Airbnb made up nearly 20 percent, according to Second Measure data. HomeAway, its home-sharing competitor owned by the travel booking site Expedia, brought in 11 percent.**  That’s impressive considering the US hotel industry brings in more than $200 billion in revenue a year. Note that Airbnb only considers its revenue to be the fees it gets from renters and travelers, not the gross bookings — what consumers spend — that would be included in the Second Measure data. It’s a different revenue model from hotels, which take in all the gross bookings but also have much higher expenses like building and running the hotels.     Airbnb’s revenue in this data would include the total amount consumers spend on its lodgings and its “ experiences ,” while the hotel data would include room prices as well as food, beverages, and incidentals. Basically, everything that would show up on the consumer’s credit card bill under Airbnb or these hotels (and their subsidiary brands) would be included.  Second Measure’s data is for personal US credit cards, so people traveling from abroad or using corporate accounts wouldn’t be included. Hotels tend to be more popular among business travelers — and business travelers tend to be more lucrative than leisure ones — so including them would definitely move the data in hotels’ favor.  Airbnb, however, has been trying to eat into that business travel market as well with Airbnb for Work , its segment of highly rated lodgings that have hotel amenities and self-check-ins. Airbnb says it manages travel for 400,000 businesses, and business travelers are using the service for shorter trips — ones that might have once defaulted to hotels. The average stay with Airbnb for Work is five days, down from six days last year, according to Airbnb . The fastest-growing segment of business trips is three nights or fewer.  Analysts estimate Airbnb brought in more than $3 billion globally in 2018. Unlike a number of other startups planning to go public , it’s been profitable on an Ebitda basis for two years.  * Includes InterContinental Hotels Group, Hilton Worldwide, Marriott International, Starwood, Choice Hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group, La Quinta, Hyatt, and all of their subsidiary brands. ** HomeAway revenue includes VRBO and vacationrentals.com.

But it also can be seen as part of a bigger strategy for Google Maps to push to be more of an app for events discovery. [ Jon Porter / The Verge ]  With its new credit card, Apple is now battling the same banks that built Apple Pay.  Apple announced a new credit card today for iPhone owners that will be backed by Goldman Sachs. That means Apple will be competing with banks like Chase and Citi to get iPhone users to choose the Apple Card over traditional credit cards as their default choice in Apple Pay. As Jason Del Rey writes, the move is “the latest example of the biggest players in the tech industry leveraging their dominance among modern consumers for cooperation from titans of traditional industries,” and one that established Apple as a competitor in financial services.

The streaming service will offer exclusive shows, movies and documentaries from acclaimed filmmakers like JJ Abrams, Steven Spielberg and M. Night Shyamalan. The launch event also saw the announcement of an Apple credit card ( Apple Card ), a magazine and news subscription service called Apple News Plus , and a gaming streaming platform called Apple Arcade – but it was the TV Plus platform that drew the most interest. Here's the full list of the first Apple TV Plus shows The service will include shows like Amazing Stories and The Morning Show, and stars like Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell and Jason Momoa are signed up to be involved. There's even a Sesame Street spin-off show for the pre-school crowd called Helpsters. Unlike the basic package of Hulu, Apple TV Plus will be ad-free from the start, and will be available in 100-plus countries through a section of the Apple TV app. It will be available starting in autumn 2019 (September through November) on smart TVs, MacOS and iOS. Here's everything you need to know about Apple Arcade And here's all the info on Apple News Plus Cut to the chase What is it? A rival streaming service that Apple will place its own content on, among other titles. When will it be released? Autumn 2019 (September through November) How much will it cost? That's still, irritatingly, to be confirmed. In addition to Apple TV Plus, Apple introduced Apple TV Channels, which combines cable subscription services and streaming services like Amazon Prime Video into the Apple TV app. (Unfortunately, however, Apple TV Channels doesn't incorporate Netflix.) Apple TV Channels will be incorporated into the Apple TV app on iOS starting in May, and on MacOS later in the year, but will sit outside Apple TV Plus' purview. So Apple TV Plus is like Netflix? So here's where things get a bit nebulous. On stage, Cook made it very clear that Apple TV Plus isn't Netflix – at least not yet. While the service will offer original content by the boatload, Apple TV Plus won't offer licensed content – syndicated shows like The Big Bang Theory, Mr. Robot or Seinfeld. For now, you'll still have to buy those shows a la carte through iTunes or via your terrestrial cable app in Apple TV Channels. There's also the question of availability. Cook named a number of major TV manufacturers who will offer the new Apple TV app in his keynote, but never came close to mentioning all the platforms where Netflix is available, like Android TV, PC desktops and laptops, and non-Apple tablets. How much will Apple TV Plus cost? That's another mystery, as Tim Cook ended the keynote without divulging how much Apple TV Plus will set you back every month. The chances are very good, however, that the service will cost something – as talent on this scale doesn't come cheap. The silver lining to Apple creating its own content, though, is that the service could be relatively cheap – only a few dollars / pounds per month. As we know from Netflix, licensing syndicated content isn't cheap, and those contracts eventually end and must either be renewed or dropped altogether. Apple TV Plus: the launch as it happened We live -blogged the whole Apple event, and if you're wondering how Apple brought to life this new TV Plus service, here are all the details: All times US Pacific Time (PDT) 11:46 - Oprah is off, Tim is back. Looks like we're wrapping up, which is great for my fingers. This is been a long one and I've needed the toilet for a long, long time. And yep - that's it. He's done. And with no hands on reviews to be done with the services, this seems like a much easier ride for your favorite TechRadar folk. Except for the fact we'll now be noodling away at the big news, features and analysis on what's just been announced. Apart from that. 11:43 - She's making one of the biggest book clubs on the planet, Oprah and the author streamed to every device and Apple Store. To connect everyone with books, is Oprah's dream. 11.41 - Oprah has joined forces with Apple - to create meaningful ways to initiate positive change. She has two documentaries in the works - Toxic Labor (talking about the scourge and toll of sexual harassment in the workplace), and an unnamed one that focuses on mental health and how scenarios that cause problems decimate life. She wants to replace stigma with compassion and honesty... lofty goals there. 11.39 - Oprah just came on stage (possibly) clutching vouchers for cars. iPrah in the offing? She's talking about the way we all crave connections. How we want to be heard but also need to listen. If she announces the Airpower mat I'll be impressed. 11:37 - There's no word on pricing yet - that's a real shame. It's a huge part - but Tim says 'this is just a sneak peek' as he wanders back on stage. Wait, there's one more 'remarkable story teller'. 11:36 - Apple TV+ will come across all your Apple devices and smart TVs. It's an ad-free subscription service, on demand and coming this Fall with new additions every month, focusing on Apple Originals. 11:33 - Original shows and movies will be coming to the Apple+ platform. 'To brighten our day and make us think that anything is possible.' The message, again, is about quality. When will it be coming, and how much though? 11:29 - Sara Bareilles and JJ Abrams are on stage, talking about their new project: Little Voice, a romantic comedy about what's 'wonderful and transformative' about someone having to find their way through their voice. Sara is having a sing of theme tune for us now. It's a nice time to try and rest the fingers and tidy up this blog... no, she's just finished! SING MORE DO AN ENCORE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Nope, it's too late. 11.26 - I'm watching Sesame Street for work. I never knew this day would come, but suddenly it's here. There's a new pre-school show called Helpsters, with a little muppet called Cody. And it's about coding! This is related to Apple's Swift Playgrounds, you just watch. 11.25 - There's a lot about worthy storytelling here. Apple has been making a big, big push about quality elements today, that there's some gravitas to everything that it's doing. AS I WRITE THAT BIG BIRD COMES ON STAGE. Thanks Apple. 11.24 - He's going to be pushing a program called Little America, with small stories from immigrants - and the directors are either immigrants or children of immigrants. 'We hope Little America will help people to understand there is no other, there is only us'. 11:20 - Kumail Nanjiani is on stage, the actor from Silicon Valley. He's just chatting about his life now, making some jokes. This is a very different Apple event, to be honest. 11.16 - Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard are on stage to talk up the new programming where the world is blind after a virus wipes out sight and most of the human race, in 'See', a new show coming to Apple TV+. 11:15 - This trio will be the main characters in the show - the characters with which the issues are lensed. 'Shining a light on the fault lines in our society'. 11:14 - Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are now on stage - they're doing 'The Morning Show' on Apple TV as well. An insiders view into the lives of the morning newscaster. An 'honest look' at the complex relationship between women and men. Steve Carrell just wandered late on stage. He's making jokes about not knowing whether it's his turn. 11.11 - The video is over, the audience has gone crazy to Steven Spielberg to come on stage. He likes Apple, apparently. He's, once again, talking up how important storytelling is. Spielberg is going to be resurrecting 'Amazing Stories' for Apple TV. 11:08 - The video is still going on, the normal Apple 'enchanting' video, where the world of creativity, the wonder it presents, makes the viewer want to be part of it. To want to be involved in the Apple world. 11:07 - Actors are talking about how they 'imagine' what the character would be thinking when they embody them. Thanks for that. 11:06 - Spielberg is talking about how stories are so important. 'The best stories have come to me when I least expected them.' 11:04 - The power of stories is important. 'Here at Apple we know incredible stories begin and end with the artists that create them'. We're going to meet some of them. This service is dedicated to 'the best stories ever told'. This sounds interesting... the 'art of great storytelling'. 11.03 - And here's the big news: Apple TV+. Everyone has lost their minds suddenly here.

Members of parliament voted 348 in favor of the law and 274 against. A last-minute proposal to remove the law’s most controversial clause — known as Article 13 or the ‘upload filter’ — was narrowly rejected by just five votes. The directive will now be passed on to EU member states, who will have 24 months to translate it into national law.  The Copyright Directive has been in the works for more than two years, and has been the subject of fierce lobbying from tech giants, copyright holders, and digital rights activists.  a “dark day for internet freedom”  Julia Reda, an MEP for the German Pirate Party who led much opposition to the directive, said it was a “dark day for internet freedom.” Andrus Ansip, vice president of the European Commission and a key advocate for the law, said it was a “big step ahead” that would unify Europe’s digital market while protecting “online creativity.”  Details of legislation will have to be decided by individual EU member states, but the law will likely have a huge impact on how the internet works in Europe and further afield. As we saw with GDPR, the EU’s data protection legislation , European laws can influence US policy.  Advocates of the directive say it will balance the playing field between American tech giants and European content creators, giving copyright holders power over how internet platforms distribute their content. But critics say the law is vague and poorly thought-out, and will end up restricting how content is shared online, stifling innovation and free speech.    Dark day for internet freedom: The @Europarl_EN has rubber-stamped copyright reform including #Article13 and #Article11 . MEPs refused to even consider amendments. The results of the final vote: 348 in favor, 274 against #SaveYourInternet  pic.twitter.com/8bHaPEEUk3 — Julia Reda (@Senficon) March 26, 2019     The internet’s new police: the ‘link tax’ and ‘upload filter’  Despite setbacks , the most controversial clauses in the Copyright Directive — Article 11 or the ‘link tax’ and Article 13 or the ‘upload filter’ — have remained largely intact.  Article 11 lets publishers charge platforms like Google News when they display snippets of news stories, while Article 13 (renamed Article 17 in the most recent draft of the legislation) gives sites like YouTube new duties to stop users from uploading copyrighted content.  In both cases, critics say these well-intentioned laws will create trouble. Article 13, for example, could lead to the introduction of “upload filters” that will scan all user content before it’s uploaded to sites to remove copyrighted material. The law does not explicitly call for such filters, but critics say it will be an inevitability as sites seek to avoid penalties.  Advocates for the directive say that claims Article 13 will “kill off memes” are exaggerations, and that the legislation includes protections for parody. But experts say any filters that are introduced will likely be error-prone and ineffective. They also note that given the cost of deploying such technology, the law may have the opposite effect to its intent — accidentally solidifying the dominance of US tech giants over online spaces.  The possible effects of the link tax are equally tricky to predict. The law is mainly focused on services like Google Search and Google News, which show snippets of news articles. Google has said that if newspaper choose to charge licenses for this material it will be forced to strip back the content it shows in search and shutter Google News altogether.  Critics have accused the company of deploying scare tactics, circulating stripped-down screenshots of Google Search like the one below. But the link tax has been introduced in both Germany and Spain, and both times it was a failure.            Google’s proposal for what Google Search could look like under Article 11 of the copyright directive.  Credit: Google    ACTIVISTS COMMISERATE, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS CELEBRATE  The approval of the copyright directive will be upsetting for many across Europe. More than one hundred thousand individuals have protested the legislation over the past few weeks, and more than five million signed a petition calling for the removal of Article 13. Last week, sites including Reddit, PornHub, and Wikipedia also protested the legislation.  Most individuals are worried that their experience of the web will be adversely affected, but the legislation will also have a huge affect on business people. “Anyone developing a platform with EU users that involves sharing links or content faces great uncertainty,” said Tal Niv, vice president of law and policy at code depository GitHub, in a statement. “The ramifications include being unable to develop features that web users currently expect, and having to implement very expensive and inaccurate automated filtering.”  Google said that the will “lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe’s creative and digital economies.” The company added that the exact implementation of the directive by member states would be crucial. “The details matter, and we look forward to working with policy makers, publishers, creators and rights holders,” said a spokesperson.  Despite these reactions, industry groups from the world of music, publishing, and film celebrated the passage of the law. “This is a vote against content theft,” said Xavier Bouckaert, president of the European Magazine Media Association in a press statement. “Publishers of all sizes and other creators will now have the right to set terms and conditions for others to re-use their content commercially, as is only fair and appropriate.”  Experts in copyright law said that despite both jubilant and unhappy reactions, the real test is yet to come. “This outcome is unpopular with digital services and importantly, many European voters,” said Raffaella De Santis, technology and media lawyer at Harbottle & Lewis in a statement. “The key focus now will be on how the directive is implemented across the EU over the next two years.”       Next Up In Tech                         Most Read                  Apple announces Apple Card credit card  Coming summer 2019              The Apple Card is Apple’s thinnest and lightest status symbol ever  There was one hardware announcement at Apple’s services event              All the things Apple didn’t tell us about its streaming TV service  Apple TV Plus is more mysterious than familiar                        Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.    email address...

By  Jason Del Rey @DelRey    Mar 25, 2019,  5:59pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Apple’s new credit card means the tech giant is now battling the same banks that built Apple Pay      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Apple introduced Apple Card on Monday, March 25, at an event in Cupertino, Calif.  Apple     The new Apple credit card the company announced on Monday does more than give its users cash back and cool iPhone features. It also pits Apple against the same big banks it needed to get its Apple Pay service off the ground more than four years ago.  The Apple Card, backed by Goldman Sachs, carries no fees and 2 percent “daily” cash back when someone uses it to make a purchase via Apple Pay’s payment service. Apple Pay is an increasingly popular payment method in apps and on websites, and can also be used for tap-to-pay phone payments in brick-and-mortar stores.  That means Apple is now going to be competing with banks like Chase and Citi to get iPhone users to choose the Apple Card as the default card for Apple Pay payments.  “They relied on a whole ecosystem of banks to build out Apple Pay to get it to where it is today, and now they’re making a conscious decision to compete directly with those partners,” said Jordan McKee, research director at 451 Research.  Apple’s move is just the latest example of the biggest players in the tech industry leveraging their dominance among modern consumers for cooperation from titans of traditional industries. Often, that cooperation turns into competition.  The Apple Card will also allow iPhone users to track their weekly and monthly spending across shopping categories. At least for now, those features don’t appear to be open to iPhone users using another bank’s card.  “They’re not just competing in Apple Pay, but they are [also] opening up features only for the Apple Card that other banks can’t leverage,” McKee said.  Still, it’s tough to want to shed tears for America’s big banks. They have a history of making big money by selling your data so marketers have a new contact to hawk their services or wares. They’ve also collectively made fortunes by charging sometimes-usurious penalty interest rates and other late fees . It seems, at least initially, as though Apple is taking a shot directly at the industry by prioritizing privacy with no data sharing or selling, as well as biometric authentication. The card also carries no fees and no penalty interest rates.  For years, Apple downplayed the idea that it would ever compete with the banks.

American consumers spent more on Airbnb than on Hilton last year  That means Airbnb now owns about 20 percent of the entire US consumer lodging market.

Catherine Shu,technology,"                        Google will open a new office complex and add hundreds of jobs in Taiwan     Catherine Shu   @catherineshu  / 13 hours         Google announced today it will expand its office space in Taiwan with a new complex in Banqiao District, New Taipei City. The space will be in Taipei Far Eastern Telecom Park, about a 20-minute drive away from its offices in Taipei 101. Google currently has 2,000 employees in the country and plans to hire several hundred more, with an emphasis on hiring more women, said Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, during a press conference today.  The complex will also play an important role in Google’s Intelligent Taiwan project, which it announced in May 2018 . Last year, the project trained about 5,000 students in AI technology and 50,000 digital marketers.  In the wake of Project Dragonfly , Google’s controversial project to build a censored version of its search engine for China, close attention will be paid to what the company does in Taiwan and its other hubs in Asia. Google reportedly halted Dragonfly last year, before employees told The Intercept that they had seen evidence of continued work on the project. A Google spokesperson said there was no link between those issues and the expansion of its Taiwan offices.  After Google completed its $1.1 billion acquisition of a large part of HTC’s smartphone unit at the beginning of 2018, Taiwan became its biggest Asian engineering hub. Google pulled out of China in 2010, citing censorship issues, and the revelation of Project Dragonfly, an apparent reversal on its earlier stance, was met with controversy internally by Google employees. The company’s potential re-launch in China was also one of the main topics of questioning during CEO Sundar Pichai’s House Judiciary committee hearing in December.

The latest salvo in that effort is Firefox Lockbox for Android , which promises to securely and privately store passwords, while ensuring people remain logged in to their favorite apps and services. But does the world need another password manager?       TNW Conference is coming up in Amsterdam  You should definitely be there   See why    Maybe. What Firefox Lockbox does well compared to other password managers is the initial setup process, which is designed to be as painless as possible.  Once you’ve installed the app, it automatically copies over your passwords from Firefox, saving you time that would otherwise be spent manually typing them in one-by-one. Another advantage of this is that you know they’ll work, as they’re the same passwords as those saved in your phone’s autocomplete.  Once you’ve copied them over, you can subsequently access them in plaintext by using your phone’s fingerprint reader, or with facial recognition. And as a plus, it connects to the desktop version of Firefox, saving you from duplicated effort. According to Mozilla, credentials are protected with 256-bit encryption.  Firefox Lockbox is available to download now from Google Play . iPhone fans will be glad to know that there’s an iOS version, which Mozilla says has been downloaded 50,000 times so far. You can grab that here .

The 1080p device, first introduced in 2015, is still priced at $149 and now has a clear title that differentiates it from the Apple TV 4K -- a slightly newer, pricier and, of course, 4K-compatible version of the set-top box.            The name change comes as Apple gets ready to ramp up its push into original programming. The company spent the majority of its event highlighting Apple TV+ , an ad-free subscription-based streaming video service. A number of celebrities including Reese Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Momoa, Kumail Nanjiani, Big Bird and Oprah all took the stage to highlight projects they have been working on for the service. While the name change to Apple TV HD provides a bit of clarity for Apple's set-top box offerings, the company has gone all in on the Apple TV branding, and it's not the most intuitive naming system. The company now has the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K set-top boxes. Then there's the Apple TV app that houses its new Channels service and will soon be available on smart TVs as well as Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices. Finally, there is Apple TV+, which will host the company's original content offerings.

Robin Marchant / Getty Images for Twitter     On the latest episode of Recode Decode , Backstage Capital founder Arlan Hamilton and Deeds Not Words founder Wendy Davis joined Recode’s Kara Swisher onstage to talk about being seen and heard in historically male-dominated fields; the current political climate in America; and how, sometimes at the urging of their own peers, women and people of color make apologies and accommodations for the people who discriminate against them.  Hamilton recalled a story about a successful black woman in New York who she thought was going to invest in Backstage, but instead used a meeting to give her fashion counseling:  “She said, ‘First of all, I don’t need to see you in blue anymore. You’re never going to raise money if you don’t dress the part, if you don’t dress better, if you can’t wear what you’re wearing,’” Hamilton said. “And I do believe it was well-meaning because I feel like she felt she had to do the part ... It just felt so wrong. And then about two blocks out I was like, ‘No way. That’s crazy .’ And it was literally two or three days later that Marc Andreessen invested in me for the first time.”  Hamilton and Davis spoke with Swisher at South By Southwest earlier this month; last week, Hamilton stepped down as CEO of the incubator within her firm, Backstage Studio , to be replaced by general partner Christie Pitts. Davis previously appeared on Recode Decode after launching Deeds Not Words — a nonprofit working to get women “in the room” and/or elected to political office — and confirmed on this episode that she may run against Texas Sen. John Cornyn in 2020.   You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Google Podcasts , Pocket Casts , and Overcast .

Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Arlan and Wendy.   Kara Swisher: Hey, everybody. God, I’m tired. It’s hot here in Texas. I just went on a University of Texas college tour. My son is going to college next year, he’s a junior, and that was something.  So, now I’m here and I’m so excited to do this. We have a lot of great things we’re doing here at the Vox headquarters, and we’re also going to be doing a Pivot tomorrow, a live Pivot with Scott Galloway, which should be really fun. But Mark Cuban’s coming, Peter Kafka’s coming, and Casey Newton is coming. There’s a giant quote by Casey Newton out here.  But without further ado, this is a topic I talk about a lot, I write about a lot, which is diversity and equity, gender equity and all kinds of issues. I’ve tried my hardest in Silicon Valley to remind most of the white men that women and people of color exist. And I’ve tried really hard to bring up these issues with them, because ...  Audience member: Wendy!  Okay. All right. But I’m so excited to be interviewing these two. I have interviewed both before. I’ve had Wendy on the podcast . I don’t think I’ve had Arlan on the podcast, but she’s coming. And so without further ado, Wendy Davis and Arlan Hamilton. Thank you.  Audience member: I love you, Wendy!  Wendy Davis: I love you back.  Okay. All right. So, we have so much to talk about. This is, again, called Against the Odds, this talk, although I think we’ve all done rather well in general. But I want to talk about where we are right now in the various areas. You’re in politics and the stuff you’re doing, and Arlan, what you’re doing around venture capital. Where are we against the odds, each of you? What do you think are the biggest challenges that are being faced in the areas that you are working in? Why don’t we start with you, Wendy?  WD: The area I’m working in now really is attempting to make sure that we’re involving as many young women in political discourse and political leadership as we possibly can. And it can be challenging to convince young people who’ve been ignored for such a long time, particularly in a state like ours. Young women of color who’ve been on the receiving end of so many hostile policies here in our state, to convince them that they actually have the power to make a difference is a challenge.  But we have been working all over the state and we have extraordinary young women who are stepping forward, who are wanting to participate in leading the conversation, that is reflective of them, their lives, their values. And they’re just doing amazing work. So, I’m encouraged.  On a national level, there’s been a lot of that. There’s been this new group of energy put into Congress, the squads led by AOC, apparently. All the kind of things that are going on. It seems like ... I was gonna start something called a Militia Etheridge, but I like her group better. It’s an open carry state, right?  WD: I’m gonna get a t-shirt that says that.  Go right ahead. How do you look at it compared to the national scale with Texas? It shifted really quickly.  WD: It’s shifting, and it’s shifting because in the 2018 election cycle, we demonstrated that what we’ve believed for a long time is actually true, that we are a purple state, that we are trending blue, and that when we do participate, we can really make a difference. And I think young people played ... I know young people played a huge role in that, still not yet reflective of the percentage that they occupy in the population, but their participation increased dramatically in 2018.  I think seeing that outcome, a lot of times the thing that’s most difficult to overcome is people’s belief that their voice doesn’t matter. So, when we have a robust election cycle that we did in 2018, it begins to help plant the idea and the belief in people’s minds that, “Hey, you know, it really does,” so I think we’re gonna see in Texas, just as we’ve seen in elsewhere around the country, the continued political leadership of women. We elected the first two ever in the history of the state of Texas, despite the very vast population of Latinas in our state, we finally just elected our first two Latinas to Congress, Victoria Escobar from El Paso and Sylvia Garcia from Houston. So, we’re on trend to do some amazing things.  That’s both appalling and fantastic.  WD: Yes.  Just appalling. So Arlan, speaking of that, not seeing ... Arlan and I were just at an amazing event in San Francisco called Lesbians Who Tech. We had Stacey Abrams there, Laurene Powell, Susan Wojcicki, all kinds of people. And you also talked onstage about what’s going on. Talk about not seeing. You’re a venture capitalist, a woman venture capitalist, a woman venture capitalist of color, which means you’re it, kind of thing. So, talk ... Well, yes, it’s a very small group of people.  Arlan Hamilton: It’s a small group, but it’s definitely a mighty group and I think that a lot of them were there before I was there. I was just a bit louder and more pissed off.  Talk about that. Talk about not being seen. Because I think it’s a big issue.  AH: I mean, I think the reason I started ... first of all, I’m from Texas. I grew up in Dallas. It’s really nice to be here. I started Backstage Capital because I was noticing that not only were people being overlooked, but I would reach out to people from Texas in Silicon Valley to men, investors and such, and I’d say, “Thinking about raising this fund for black people, for LGBT people,” and I would start listing things off that I was, and I would literally get emails back that would say, “You can’t talk about that stuff here. You can’t say it out loud.” Like, “I can’t talk about my identity out loud? We have a big problem, even bigger than I thought.”  And if that is what was happening, truly happening there, just imagine what it’s like to be ... and some of us don’t have to, we don’t have to imagine, but just imagine what it’s like to be the person who is trying to get the attention.  I had a conversation earlier today with a white man who ... we were kind of commiserating about how hard it is to get investment and he had tried many times, talked to a lot of investors and didn’t get a yes. And I said, “That’s terrible, but the point is you were able to talk to the investor. You got in the room.” That’s what I’m saying is being blocked and has been for years.  I’m actually really, though, optimistic, because it has changed so much in three years. I mean, South By has changed so much in three years. It used to be kind of you go into a corner and in some JW [Marriott] room and you kind of go and talk about diversity and, “We’re gonna make this happen,” and because those things happened, now it’s like diversity everywhere, everybody gets the diversity, you know? It’s like, “You’re getting one, too.”  I like it. “Everybody gets the diversity.” It’s like “the internets.”  AH: Yeah. Exactly.  Talk about the challenges, because you just recently, you started an accelerator, which I want to talk about in a minute. But you also recently just got into a Twitter situation with one of Silicon Valley’s biggest investors.  AH: Yeah, Paul Graham.  Paul Graham of Y Combinator.  AH: I don’t know if it was a tiff with us, because he wasn’t really volleying too much after I started talking.  Right. Explain what happened.  AH: I’ll say that I don’t have many issues with Paul. I mean, there are some kind of surface-level things and some things that I think we could talk about and I’d love to talk to him about it. I don’t have the sort of disdain, I don’t have Peter Thiel-level disdain for him.  Okay.  AH: But you know, he said something on Twitter about some of his favorite investors are operators and he listed a few and that was his business. That’s his feed. And then one of my friends on Twitter that I met before, she said, “Hey, that’s cool. That’s a great list. Maybe also talk to Arlan and then you’ll have a little broader list next time.” And he came back with, “Or maybe I could just go in the next room and talk to my wife, because she’s an investor.”  And she was not on that list.  AH: She wasn’t on the list.  Right, yeah. I noted that.  AH: She wasn’t on the list. Jessica. The thing is, okay, I’ll get into it.  I love a Twitter war, as you know.  AH: What I did was — and if you look at it, it’s all there, I didn’t delete anything — I posted it and I said, “This is a problem, because he thinks that he can walk in the next room and that’s his diversity, that’s his view. And he has a lot of power and a million people pay attention to what he says, and that’s a problem.”  So, his response to that could’ve been many things, including, “Hey, you don’t know me well enough to put that on me out here, let’s talk about it,” or, “I would prefer you didn’t put my name out your mouth.” He could’ve said all that. But instead he said, he basically accused me of being sexist and accused me of demeaning Jessica’s contribution. And that is when I took offense, because of all people, Paul Graham is not gonna tell me that I’m sexist. Of all people.  That is when his lovely minions decided they were gonna just attack everything about me and that’s when it got really ugly. Our stuff is just I’d like to have a word with him. I don’t have a problem with him having an opinion. I also don’t, it’s not my place to say that his list is wrong. That’s his list. He didn’t come to my list and say, “No, I don’t like Drake.” That’s fine. But it’s the fact that his go-to, his defense is to kind of throw his wife under the bus whether she believes it or not, that’s how I saw it and that’s how a lot of people saw it.  All right. Wendy, talking about this. This is like Silicon Valley ...  AH: Yeah, you’re like a ...  But it’s typical all through, the idea of not opening things up. Talk a little bit about, you started a group after you were a legislator. Talk a little bit about what you’ve done since then. We did a great podcast about Deeds Not Words . Where do you imagine we are? Because it does feel like we’re sort of in this in-between place right now, that it looks like forces of progressives are on the rise, and at the same time, the retrograde is happening. It feels super confusing to me, at least.  WD: Yeah. To your point, Arlan, they’re not gonna just make the room available to you, right? You have to kick the door open. And that’s what we’re trying to teach young women to do. Deeds Not Words exists very specifically and only to make sure that we are helping to show young women a path to effectively using their voices.  It is not lack of passion that millennials or Generation Z suffer from. It’s sometimes a lack of understanding about how to be most effective in getting their voices and their passions moved to the forefront of conversation. So, we spend a whole lot of time with them. We have 19 high school and college chapters around the state and we spend a whole lot of time in that Texas capitol where these young women come. They take the capitol by storm in a beautiful way. They testify in committee hearings, they are working on a number of issues, all of which fall in some way, shape, or form under a gender equity umbrella.  One of the biggest issues they’re working on in this legislative session centers around the backlog of rape kits in our state. Sexual assault reform, making sure that all those protections for our campuses that are being stripped away by Betsy DeVos under Title IX are being reinstated at the state level. And when they show up in these committee hearings, because they’ve been helped to figure out where is the room and how do I get in the room, and how do I sign up to speak in the room, and when I do get recognized in the room, how do I best present myself, we do a lot of work with them on that.  And I’m telling you, when they sit down, these lawmakers, some of the crustiest old white Republican lawmakers, they just sit up and take notice. And so many of their bills that they work on sail out of committee unanimously. Two years ago, our girls helped to pass seven bills into law and they’re gonna have an even bigger record this time, so they’re doing it.  And I think when we show young women how to be powerful in those spaces, what I hope happens is that they sit in those committee hearings, they look up at that dais, and they say, “I want to be there. I belong there. I’m gonna run and I’m gonna beat your ass, and I’m gonna be sitting up there making that decision one day.”  When you look back at what happened with you, when you reflect back on it, it seems like you’ve gone back, you did this filibuster , so well known. How do you reflect on that? Because you were pushing, pushing, pushing, pushback, and it keeps pushing back. That’s one of the things that I think a lot of people who are running, when they start to ... obstacles start to naturally form, not naturally, unnaturally form in their way, really. How do you think about your experience? What happened to you now, reflecting back on it?  WD: Well, I think it was ...  And for those who don’t know, explain.  WD: I conducted a 13-hour filibuster to try to kill — thank you — to try to kill a bill that would be very bad for women’s ability to access safe and legal abortion in our state. And what was beautiful about that experience, it didn’t have anything to do with what I did, it was the fact that in a state where we believe the deck is stacked so high against us, we give up before we even start. For whatever reason on that day, thousands and thousands and thousands of women, and many men as well, stormed the Texas capitol. And it was because of them in the final 15 minutes of that night when the filibuster was ultimately called to an end, it was the use of not just their figurative voices but their literal ones as they screamed with all their might that they kept a bill from passing by the midnight deadline.  Now, the next day it passed into law, or the next week. They called us back to another special session. It passed into law. All of our fears came true. Clinics across the state closed. Women lost their access to that care and we started seeing the ripple effect that we knew would follow it. Medicaid births went up exponentially. Teen birth rates went up exponentially. Our maternal mortality rate went up exponentially. And of course, self-induced abortion went up. And women’s health care was compromised. But the great thing was we never gave up. We took it all the way to the Supreme Court and three years later, the Supreme Court overturned that law. Yes, please clap. That’s great.  So, what we learned in that experience in the state where we tend to give up before we even start is that you just have to keep pressing ahead. Own your truth, own what you know is the right thing to do, and before long, you’re going to really begin to move the needle. And here’s why I feel like we have been so successful, and when I say we, I mean the collective we in Texas that have been working so hard on issues like this. In this legislative session, we flipped 12 house seats, we flipped two senate seats. That’s unheard of, by the way. It was extraordinary that we did it, yes. We have nine seats left to go in the Texas house to completely flip it into Democratic control and we’re gonna do everything we can in 2020 to make that happen.  But in the meantime, because people worked so hard and particularly women, women in the state kicked ass. Not just in running, but in being the people who were creating their own grassroots organizations, turning people out to vote, doing all the hard volunteer work that it takes to succeed for candidates in our state. And it was because of them that those seats flipped, and the legislators know that.  And what has been so fascinating to watch, some of these Republicans who did come back, but they barely came back, they almost lost their seats, those are my favorite ones to watch in the session, because suddenly they’re trying to look like the greatest champion and friend to women you’ve ever seen. They recognize our power. And I can just feel us at a tipping point right now, and I feel like even in a place like Texas, we’re gonna actually start moving some incredibly important progressive values forward, because they just can’t ignore us anymore.  So, she said, “even in a place like Texas.” It should not be that way, “even in a place like San Francisco,” or, “even in a place like Palo Alto.” How do you assess the situation? You said it’s gotten better.  WD: Yeah.  I don’t perceive that in any way whatsoever.  AH: Cool beans. Cool beans. It has. First of all, it has because ... I don’t know if I would be able to get up every day and do what we do if it hadn’t. It’s not a dramatic change, but it is different. It has nothing to do with some sort of angelic men coming together and saying it’s better now. It is a lot of ...  Explain what “better” is from your perspective.  AH: The fact that we’re talking about it. The fact that it’s no longer whispered and there’s a lot of people ... there are a lot of people who feel empowered right now. There’s strength in numbers.  When I think back to 2015 where it was like, I was screaming out online and in front of people saying, “Things are going to change. There’s going to be a reckoning and we have to get in front of this.” Really, the difference between that and today where, honestly, walk outside here and just take a good look at what this place looks like right now compared to what it looked like four years ago. It’s just different. And I mean, people who are in the room right now didn’t feel like they could be in the room four years ago. They didn’t feel like they were part of this. Not only do they feel invited, but they understand this is just as much theirs as it is anyone else’s.  So, talk about that in terms of venture capital and investing. How has that changed? Because the numbers, they still ...  AH: Oh, the numbers suck.  What is it? Two percent?  AH: It’s less than 2 percent for women in general.  Right.  AH: Like all women that give life, why we’re here, it’s less ...  I know, I have done that. But go ahead.  AH: Yes, I know. Less than 2 percent. And then when it comes to black women in particular, it doesn’t even register. $86 billion in 2018 in venture, most of it obviously growth and probably half of it SoftBank, but ...  Yeah. And half of that the Saudis, but let’s not mention that again.  AH: And so little ... true. So little for black women that we can’t even quantify it. And probably half of that was Zume Pizza, which is a SoftBank deal. That sucks.  So, the money is not there for women, people of color.  AH: The money is not there and that’s what I think about, we talk about what has to change, what’s next. But the point of it is that ... like if I look at it in an optimistic way, which I have to sometimes ...  Yeah, I want to understand your optimism, because I have zero.  AH: Sometimes I do. And sometimes I just lay in bed and I’m like, “Oh my god, this is a dumpster fire. This is terrible.” But the optimistic side of me says, “If it’s only taken three years for people to start shifting minds and hearts,” they say we couldn’t shift hearts. That’s the one thing that I was warned about, you’re not gonna be able to change someone’s internal thought about this and their heart about this. You may be able to talk to them about the bottom line, you may be able to ... you’re not gonna ... I see it that people have shifted their thinking and what they do on a day-to-day basis based on understanding.  Explain. Give me actual manifestation of that. What do you think they shifted? Talking about it is one thing.  WD: Absolutely.  Doing something about it is another.  WD: And there’s a lot of people who just talk about it, who like the aesthetics, a lot of people who like to take the picture with me or someone on the Backstage team because now they’re “woke.”  Yeah.  WD: You know, so I don’t, I don’t ...  I understand that’s not a word we need to use anymore but go ahead.  WD: Right. We, I don’t know who “we” are, but I’m going to use ...  I was told. I used it somewhere ...  WD: Maybe that, I don’t know, I don’t know the circumstances, so.  I was using it as a joke, but go ahead.  WD: Oh okay. Yeah, I’m always like a couple of years behind on the jargon.  Yeah, me too.  WD: So there are those, but there are people, I think — you know, you see it — I haven’t had a chance to think about it so we’ll see what happens on the Twitters when I say this. You see it with the way in which white women ally. It’s a lot less, you know, again, it’s a lot less talk and it’s a lot less sort of setting a very fine plate at a dinner table. It’s more like this is half your table and what do you want to do with your side?  And going back to my original thought, I think that that has to happen. I want things to change overnight too, like I really hate incremental change when it comes to something so important. But if we think about the fact that nothing was changing before and now three years later, I can come to an event like this, I can show people that we saw 5,000 companies that were led by an underrepresented founder in the last less than five years alone...  I can show that the 100 companies that we invested in and people aren’t afraid to listen and people back that. We have 50 million-plus follow-on funding last year alone and that wasn’t from us. That was from outside people who didn’t know these companies before that they existed. So, if I think about how much has changed in my view and how much has been accomplished by us in these three years and then I look three years ahead, that is where I get my optimism. I think things will be ... I think it’s all about leverage. I think, just like you mentioned, things are changing and the leverage is shifting.  Wendy, talk a little bit about sort of the national theme, because we’re in the middle of a presidential cycle already. I have to interview Amy Klobuchar tomorrow, for example, obviously I’m going to have to talk about the issues around her management, but that’s besides the ... Initially, because I do want to talk about tech policy and all the other things. But how do you look at it on a national level? Because again, as I said, it feels like there’s a shift but not a wave, I guess, I don’t know how the right political term is in that way.  WD: I don’t know. We’ll know more whether it’s a shift or a wave in 2020, whether the momentum that we saw beginning in ... Sorry, in 2018, whether that continues into 2020. So we’ll know more obviously in a couple of years. I feel like there’s tremendous momentum and I think it’s going to continue. Obviously we have more women ever elected to Congress than we’ve ever had before, more women of color than we’ve ever had before, and they’re changing the conversation. And not everybody’s real comfortable with it, you know, but it’s exactly what democracy is about and it’s exactly what’s supposed to happen when people come from different life experiences and different backgrounds and they move different values to what’s being heard.  So I think it’s a very healthy thing for the Democratic Party. There’s a lot of soul searching going on about, you know, whether it’s getting too scary left or whether the Democratic Party is going to turn into what we saw happen with the Republican Party with the Tea Party kind of fracturing it, but I think we can rise to the occasion. And I think the fact that so many women ran and won this time and many others ran and almost won, it’s not going to be a one-cycle phenomenon that women stepped up.  So in that vein, are you running for Senate?  WD: I might run for U.S. Senate.  And this is for Cornyn’s seat, right?  WD: For John Cornyn’s seat, yeah. It’s actually ... I should’ve said that differently. For the seat that John Cornyn currently occupies. But, you know, we’re having great conversations about that between me, Joaquin Castro, MJ Heger. We want to make sure that we’re best positioned to advance the person who’s going to take that seat and I want to be a great team player in helping to make that happen. If we decide that that’s me then I will do it. But if Joaquin decides that this is something that he wants to do, then MJ and I are going to get behind him. So, we’re working collaboratively on it.  Right. What does that mean? I just wish you would just not work collaboratively sometimes. I wish women would just say, “I will have that.” I do that all the time so I will take the most money, thank you and please give me more. But when you think about running for Senate, is there anything that detracts from it besides cooperating with others in the race? How do you look at it? Why you want to do this?  WD: Well, it’s going to be a tough race, there’s no question. When Beto ran against Ted Cruz, he had the advantage of the built-in negatives that Ted Cruz brings with him and the fact that he’s just so widely disliked. And John Cornyn has been every bit as dangerous for all of us and the future of this country and the things that we ought to be working on and yet he’s been more quiet about it.  Likable, he’s likable enough.  WD: He’s polite, you know, more polite, I guess I should say.  AH: Less creepy?  WD: A little less creepy, yeah. He doesn’t quite have that creep factor and so it makes it harder. You know, I faced that challenge in 2014 when I ran against Greg Abbott. People didn’t really know a whole lot about him, he never served in a policy-making body before, he’d been our AG and had previously been on the Supreme Court but didn’t have like a policy record that you could run against. And he’s a likable person when you have conversations with him and it’s really hard to help people understand why that person actually is going to be very, very bad for them and their families.  And there will be a challenge like that with John Cornyn, making sure that voters understand what his record has been, how very much an aide to Donald Trump he has been, and how and why for the future of this state and what we ought to be working on to make sure that our families are drinking clean water and breathing clean air and having access to health care and education and all the things that lift up our opportunities, that he’s been bad for all of those things.  So it’s not going to be easy. And the thing that I will admit, when you come through the kind of really tough race that I came through in 2014, when you get beaten by the misogynistic stick so hard it makes you struggle for air, that’s tough. I feel almost a responsibility in some ways to show young women yeah, I really got beaten hard with that stick and it hurt and it was painful but I’m strong enough to rise up over that and to not let them have the final victory over me.  Because if we allow misogyny to defeat us as women candidates in that way, if we prove to them that that’s a successful strategy not only to beat us but to take us down forevermore, then we’re empowering it and I don’t want to be a part of empowering that. It’s something that gives me pause, of course, because I know what it felt like, but it also gives me resolve in the same way.  How would you do that differently? How would you handle that differently?  WD: You know, I would handle it differently by calling it for what it is. At the time ... I’ll just give you an example. One of the things that they really went after me about was what was I considered one of my strengths as a person running for office, that I had come from poverty, that I had been a single mom, that I had worked two jobs and gone to college and ultimately made my way to Harvard Law School, and, you know, did the things that I did. And I saw that and it had previously been a strength for me in my Senate race, for example, my state Senate race. But they took my biography and they just shredded it and they made me look like I was a bad mom, that somehow I had abandoned my children.  And I remember so distinctly my two daughters having to come to a huge Democratic event in Austin, both of whom read their heartfelt remarks that they wrote about the fact that their mom was a good mom and that they love me and felt supported by me and I felt so angry in that moment that my daughters had gotten put in that position. What I would do differently is I would just call it for the baloney — to say the politest word I can think of — that it is. I would hope and I think we would have more women calling it out, too, other women on social media and otherwise who would say, “Uh-uh, we’re not suffering that.”  Well, it’s an interesting thing, I just recently interviewed Hillary Clinton , and one of the things I asked her about was the creepy thing, Trump behind her. And I’m like, “Why didn’t you turn around and say, ‘Back off,’ or something like that?” And she explained it, she thought that it would cause all kinds of problems if she had said, which was a creepy guy hovering behind her, that she would get more flak because of that. But in not saying anything she accepted what was happening, which was a creepy guy hovering behind her that she didn’t defend herself again. Arlan, when you’re thinking about that, like not looking the part of a venture capitalist, how do you ...  AH: Do I not?  You don’t look like any venture capitalist ... You do, you do to me. You do to me. But, you know, you’re not wearing the bad slacks and the Allbirds or whatever the hell ...  AH: Patagonia.  Discussing “intermittent fasting” with me. Literally, I’m like, “I’m not interested in any way by your eating schedule and you need to stop talking to me about it,” and they keep talking and finally, the way I got them to shut them down was you know, when men talk about ... When women talk about food like this they have an eating disorder, when it’s men it’s intermittent fasting.  AH: Exactly.  But, in any case ...  AH: Is there a Kara Swisher as a service?  What, in the service, what do you mean?  AH: As a service.  Yes, there is. Yes. I was going to have an ad.  AH: I just want you with me everywhere I go.  Well, you can just ... “Fuck you,” is usually a good thing.  AH: Okay. Fair enough.  Start with that and move on up the stack. But when you don’t look like that, how does it ... Has that change affected your fundraising, affecting ... You change differently, like Wendy’s now going to say, you know, I’m not, I’m a good ... You’re not going to defend her, you’re not even going to say, “I’m a good mother.”  WD: I’m not even ... It’s ridiculous.  I’m not even going to defend it, like it’s ridiculous.  WD: It doesn’t deserve a response.  How do you look when you have to sort of start to fundraise? Do you have to do something different or can you ...?  AH: I don’t do anything different than normal because I launched that way. I sort of launched ...  “This is Arlan.”  AH: This is who I am and it needs to be different. It needs to be a shake-up, what’s happening is not working so far for diversity efforts and other things. So I don’t feel ... I had one time where a black woman who is very successful and who — I think she was very well-meaning — she told me, I walked into her office I thought she might invest ... This was in New York maybe two years or plus and I walked in and I was, I forgot what it was. She saw a picture of me in a blue shirt or something and I thought we were going to have a meeting about investing and her team asked me about that. And she said, “First of all, I don’t need to see you in blue anymore. You’re never going to raise money if you don’t dress the part, if you don’t dress better, if you can’t wear what you’re wearing,” like this, right?  And I do believe it was well-meaning because I feel like she felt she had to do the part. I was crushed by that and I walked out and I was like for a split second I said, “Is this how it’s going to have to be? Do I need to like, I guess I’ll go and check out some clothes that are different.” It just felt so wrong. And then about two blocks out I was like, “No way. That’s crazy .” And it was literally two or three days later that Marc Andreessen invested in me for the first time and he invested in me, in all three funds. And I don’t think Marc cared what I was wearing, what color I was wearing, what it looked like.  No, Marc is badly dressed himself.  AH: Right, but that’s part ...  You are not badly dressed.  AH: But that’s part of it.  He happens to be, he doesn’t think about it.  AH: How in the world do we need to be wasting our time talking about, this lady and I wasting our time talking about what I’m wearing when she and I could be making power moves together but we’re talking about it because you don’t think ... She was saying out in that world, they’re going to eat you alive if you don’t dress the part. And, you know, they stole hoodies from us . I’m dressed the part. I’m dressed the part.  So as far as looking, in general the way I speak and the way I handle myself, what my thing is is what I am in life. I try to do no harm. I think of myself as a kind person. I have the best intentions, I think. Sometimes I will call people out because it’s like see something, say something. My mom taught me that early. See something, say something. But I’m not out to get anybody. I’m not out to ...  Do you need to have a massive hit to become legitimate? There’s lots of VCs that sort of have good outcomes.  AH: Yeah, exactly.  Do you get that ability to do that? There’s not that many VCs that have big hits.  AH: It’s a double standard, you know. I started getting asked about my returns, like exits, like a year in. We’re doing pre-seed deals and they’re talking about, “This is a 10-year fund with a two-year extension.” And a year in, people were like, “I need to see something. I need to see some exits from you to take you seriously.” And I knew then, I was like, “Oh, this is how that’s going to be.”  So I had a conversation with myself, as I do often, and I did answer. And I said, “You know, this is how they can ship it to me but I’m not going to accept it. I’m not going to sign for it,” is what I said in the past, right?  Right.  AH: I understand that’s going to come from me from all directions.  That you need to prove it.  AH: Earlier than anyone else.  Earlier than anybody else.  AH: Than anyone else. I sat with this guy, he was a friend of mine, he’s a white venture capitalist, has a little less than a hundred million under management. He had on his long shorts and probably Allbirds. He sat in my office one day and very casually told me how he’s in his 50-year and has had no exits, had nothing like that, having a great time though, making some great decisions in my view, and how he got $15 million with sight unseen on the next fund.  And the fact that I have those conversations and I know it’s really happening, I know what’s really happening behind closed doors in venture, allows me not to take that from people who are outside. Anyone who’s challenged how we’re doing things, our track record, any of that, A) don’t have our vision, they don’t understand that you can’t start a movement doing things the old way, and B) have never even attempted something as bold on their own.  So I think about the source, and a lot of that insecurity is theirs. I don’t have that insecurity for myself when it comes to what we’re doing. I hold myself, however, to a very high standard and I know the milestones and the KPIs [Key Performance Indicators] that we must hit in our opinion as a fund and as a firm and that is what’s important to us and to our portfolio and to our LPs. If you’re not writing a check and you’re not an LP, you know, I’m not having that conversation necessarily with them, but absolutely, to answer your question, since almost day one it has been double standard always.  “What’s going on? What are you doing?”  AH: Oh, sure, you know, because a couple of things. I was bold and I said I believe this is going to work and people want to see results, but also some people, you know, they want to stand against the wall, do nothing, and put their foot out. And, you know, I’m Jackie Jackson, I’m over here just jumping.  I’ve heard that. I’ve heard that about several ... I’ve heard about you. I’ve heard about several women funds and it’s often by someone who just sucks.  AH: Absolutely!  And what’s interesting is someone who actually did say something about you and I think another woman’s fund and I said, “Well, you really suck, actually.” And they’re like, “What?” And I go, “You really suck. If they suck, you really suck.”  AH: Oh yeah, exactly.  Like, you know, if you want to do it on that curve and it was a really interesting thing they’re like, “Well, it’s just my opinion.” I said, “Your opinion’s stupid, but let’s move on.”  AH: Thank you. That’s the deck.  It’s sort of like when you talk to a board, like you know when they had the Twitter board, I heard a story saying “all men and no women of the Twitter board” when they have 10 white guys on it.  AH: Yeah, and like all of them were named the same, like started with a J.  It was the best lead I ever wrote, I should’ve retired after it. It was a story about the board of Twitter and I said, “Here on the board of Twitter, which has three Peters and a Dick,” which was such a ... And they did, they actually did.  AH: They literally did.  Which was a great lead, I thought so. But one of the things ... Dick called me, it was Dick Costolo, and said, it was so funny, he’s like, “All right, first of all, that’s really unfair, but very funny,” which is why I like Dick Costolo. And he said, “Well, it’s not fair to do this,” and I said, “It’s mathematically impossible that this happened, that you have the same exact people on the board.” And he said ... And I say this all the time, he said, “Well, you know, we have standards.” That’s the thing they tend to say.  AH: Yeah, ooh.  So then I said, “Why is it the word ‘standard’ only comes up when it’s mentioning women, people of color, and it’s never the 10 white guys who have been running Twitter into a wall for years now?” It was really interesting, it’s a really interesting thing. Not to say that you couldn’t screw up or you couldn’t screw up, but it was a really interesting ...  AH: Jason Calacanis once said that he was — again, I think he might’ve had some good intentions with it, foot-in-mouth disease — but he said, you know, “What you need to do is lower your standards so you can invest in more people of color,” or something really stupid he said. And I said, “I may lower my standards and have coffee with you and tell you why that’s wrong.”  Did you?  AH: We ended up talking on his podcast, yeah. We had a little conversation.  But he will talk to you, which is really great.  AH: Oh yeah, he will.  To finish up, we’re going to have some questions from the audience to get ready, we’ll have about 10 minutes or so for questions. What do you think the key things are for — this [session] is called “Against All Odds,” I’m not sure I kind of understand that — but what do you think are the key things you need to do today in the areas you’re in? Like you said, you’re not going to pay attention anymore, what do you think the key attributes would you say for people to be successful in your each areas? Wendy, why don’t you start?  WD: I would say it’s fearlessness, but it’s not really fearlessness because everyone feels fear. And when you’re doing hard things, no matter if it’s in the political world, the financial world, you feel fear. The real challenge is gaining the ability to push through fear and to center yourself around something that’s bigger than you that you believe in so strongly, as Lady Bird Johnson would say, “You forget to be afraid.” That, I think, is our great challenge but also our great opportunity, because if we can gain the ability to do that, we are capable of doing anything.  And to go back to what I said earlier, a big problem that we have in the political context is that people have been conditioned to believe that their voices won’t matter, and it’s taught them over time not to participate, and so our great challenge is to continue work on helping people to see that they have the power to make extraordinary differences. Whether it’s writing a $5 check, whether it’s taking their one responsibility to go and vote, working on a campaign or running for office themselves.  That’s really the only way we’re ever going to change this, and that’s the remarkable, wonderful thing that happened after November 8th of 2016 is that so many people woke up and said, “I can no longer rely on other people to do this. I’m going to have to take responsibility and do my part,” and I think we’re going to continue to see people do that through 2020. And I hope, if we do elect a Democratic president in 2020, we won’t then decide we don’t need to worry about things anymore.  As in, “Phew, that’s over.”  WD: Yeah. That we’ll just stay as vigilant and involved as we need to be.  How about you, Arlan?  AH: That’s great. I think when I think about the next few years, for us to be successful we have to cut out the noise. We have to also realize, let’s not rewrite history. Y Combinator in its first year was a few poorly dressed nerds in a room eating chili, and they then had time, resources, space to breathe, all of that, and that is what ... Why you have Airbnb and Dropbox and all of these wonderful companies now, and it’s why they do wield so much power, and we respect them and kind of emulate them in some ways.  So we’re however many years or months into this renaissance as women of color and other underrepresented, underestimated people. We can’t get complacent. I don’t think we will. We can’t be beaten down by those people on the sidelines who are truly on the sidelines. Not doing anything, throwing at us their opinions.  And so I’ll close it by saying something that, once again, I’ll quote my mom. She said this to me. She was quoting something that she didn’t know where the quote came from, but she told me this while she was talking about a medical situation she was in, and she said to me, “The seed does not always see the petal.” And of course it was emotional and everything, but if you think about that, think about all of what we’re going through right now, even though we’re early in this, all of it is for something, and if we get distracted by mediocre people telling us what we’re doing wrong, we’ve completely lost the plot ourselves.  That’s a really good point. I think it’s really interesting observing, just listening to. One of the things that they always say about women who are super tough or say things out loud or aloud, “Those women don’t give a fuck.” They say it about me a lot, other people. I think what the real issue is, we give all the fucks. Do you know what I mean? We don’t not give a fuck. We give all of them.  WD: That’s right.  And I think that’s a very big differential. Okay. Questions from the audience. Put up your hands. We have a mic. Please ask questions of these women. Right here.   AH: Shout out to all the introverts as well.  Audience member: Hello. Where do you think the primary responsibility for increasing diversity lies: among the powerful or among the marginalized? On the one hand, I see narratives like Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In basing almost an unfair burden on women, and blaming them for not asserting themselves, but on the other, as women it’s difficult to understand how to affect change without relying on our own agency. So how do each of you strike that balance?  I like that you wrote that down.  AH: Yeah.  That’s so cool. Everybody else better have a question or I will ask you myself to ask a question. Go ahead. Who do you think it relies on?  WD: Are you talking to me first?  Yes. I’m talking to you.   WD: So I really liked what Arlan said a minute ago about white women and the evolving role of understanding how it is that we own responsibility for making sure that we are not just setting the table, but instead making room at the table and saying, “Here’s your half. What do you want to do with it?”  So part of it is recognizing power and privilege and the role that you play in it, right, and making sure that you are taking the time and doing the work to not lift other people up, but to give them the space to be able to lift themselves.  I remember reading Sheryl Sandberg’s book and I had this visceral reaction to it. Maybe it’s part of my own story. I’m sure Arlan could talk about this from her amazing life story that she’s had, but the obstacles that are in the way of women, and particularly women of color, are not there because of some failure on our part. The idea that we just aren’t doing enough — and if we will just represent ourselves better and do more, then we can accomplish it — completely gives a pass to the structures that have been in place, the systemic structures that have held women — and women of color particularly — back. And unless and until we take those on and force changes in them, we’re not going to have the opportunity to even be in the room that lets us lean in, right?  I think that’s right. I used to tell Sheryl she should have called it Lean In and Fall Over because that’s the experience of most people. But Arlan? Go ahead.  AH: I agree completely, and my first answer to myself was both. It’s a combination. Lena Waithe says it best when she talks about allyship. She’s like, get out the way. Get out the way and let us do our thing. But it’s both because there is that responsibility of those who do have privilege. By the way, we all have privilege. We have some privilege. Everyone in this room has a different privilege.  It’s my responsibility not to only focus on myself and what I’m working on, but to also kind of listen and be sure that I’m looking, and the elevator thing, sending it back down or up or side to side. But most important — I love allies and I care about them and I’m very grateful to them — but mostly I’m all about us just doing it ourselves.  We don’t need permission to be in a home that we partially own ourselves. The allyship, even the people who are oppressing, I like that they’re becoming more woke. I do. It will make for a better party when we jam, but we’re going to do it either way.  Yeah. I think it’s important to shame the powerful almost continually. I think it’s great. They’re very ... It’s very easy to do. Negging works particularly well as you move up the billionaire scale. Something I often do is sometimes I objectify them. It’s like, “Did you gain five pounds?” Often, I got to tell you, it works.  AH: I have a question. Can I do a question in the Q&A?  Sure.  AH: I was wondering, you interview so many people that are just ... Zuck, you’ve interviewed him many times during the shitshow that is ... All of that, and you’ve been doing this for a long time, and you have ...  I’m 103 years old.  AH: My question is, I think I know, but I really would love to know how you think about this. Why do you think people ...  Continue to talk to me?  AH: Because you’re so honest, and you’re putting a mirror up to them.  Yeah.  AH: They don’t have anywhere to hide with you.  They don’t, no.   AH: Is it because they just respect you that much because you’re doing that?  Sure. Yeah, respect. That’s it. No.  AH: They’re terrified of you.  It’s interesting because I don’t know why Mark Zuckerberg keeps talking to me. It’s not good for him. It never is. It ends badly, and the last time, the Holocaust deniers , I was like ... When he started going down that road, by the way, he was saying Holocaust deniers don’t mean to lie, and so I just let him keep talking. All right, they do, but okay.  I think there’s two things. Marc Andreessen has a theory that it’s Stockholm Syndrome in Silicon Valley, and they just don’t know what to do but talk to me.  AH: They would be lost if you weren’t showing up at their door?  Yeah. They’re like, “We got to talk to her.” I think the issue is, I think smart people ultimately like smart questions, and instead, a lot of reporters tend to beat around the bushes. Like, “I hear, Mark, that there’s some issues around privacy at Facebook, and you might ...” and I’m like, “What the fuck are you doing?!” That kind of thing. I think people appreciate that because you’re not hiding the question, and I think that’s probably one of the reasons.  The other one is, I know more than they do. I just do. I don’t know better, because they’re billionaires. They’ve done very well, but I do talk to more people, and so when they start down the road, they go down Bullshit Avenue or Obfuscation Lane I go, “No, no, no, no,” and they’re like, “Uh oh. What does she know? Maybe she doesn’t realize.” They don’t know what I know, and I think it’s a really very good weapon in that regard because I actually do know. So when they tend to do that I tend to stop them.  AH: So it’s a combination: a little bit of their ego and their intelligence.  Right.  AH: That’s trapping them into, “I have to be interviewed,” or, “I’m not relevant right now if I’m not being interviewed.”  Well, that’s part of it, too. Like sometimes when a really powerful person goes, “Oh, I should come on your podcast,” I’m like, “I don’t know,” and then they’re like, “But I want to!” and I’m like, “Maybe.”  AH: Is any bit of it like you hypnotizing them with the sunglasses?  Yes. That’s it. That’s it.  AH: Cool.  I think people want to ultimately tell the truth, ultimately, and it’s sort of like that movie with Tom Cruise when he goes, “Tell me the truth.” That whole scene.  AH: “You can’t handle the truth.”  No, you couldn’t handle the truth. I want to know the truth, and so I tend to do that.  AH: Okay.  I don’t know why. They’re stupid. I can’t tell you why. I think a lot of people don’t ask the direct question. I think the direct question is always the best question, and it’s what people want to know, and I think it’s really important, and I also don’t treat them ... I don’t lick them up and down all day like most people.  AH: That’s a visual that I’ll never be able to forget.  But they do! They get licked up and down all day, and then they think they hung the moon. I’m like, “You didn’t. I was there when you didn’t have any money and I was there when this was happening and don’t pull that crap with me.” I don’t know. I wouldn’t do an interview with me.  In any case, another question, please. Right here. But thank you for asking that.  Audience member: I’m going to totally fan girl out right now. I love all three of you. Arlan, you said something about changing hearts as well as changing minds. Kara, you contribute now to the New York Times.  Yes.  Audience member: President Obama this past week said if you read the New York Times and you watch Fox News, you feel like you’re living in two different worlds.  Yep.  Audience member: And if you’re stuck in one of those filter bubbles, you don’t know what’s happening in the other. So the question is how do you break the filter bubble, and how do you think we as a society will reach across the island and break those filter bubbles to change hearts?  I don’t know. Everybody’s got a filter. I have some thoughts. My mother watches Fox News all the time, and I was one time caught in her apartment during a snowstorm, and it was on full play all the time, and I literally by the end of it I was homicidal. So they’re very deft at propaganda. That’s what it is, come on. Read the Jane Mayer piece . Come on, stop. And by the way, look, the New York Times is liberal. They are. They are.  Well, they’re sort of center-liberal or something, but I think that ... I don’t know if we can, and I think our country’s always been that way. Back to the time of Hamilton and Washington. There were competing news. The whole idea of the press being in the middle is a new phenomena, and I don’t think it’s ever really been true.  The one thing the right wing has done really well is used the internet, because they were pretty much zeroed out from the major networks. The major networks were centrist liberal kind of, liberalish, liberal-light kind of stuff, and so I think that it’s really hard when you get ... especially when you have someone like President Trump who really just keeps repeating untrue lies constantly.  I think people are sort of like, “Well …” They equalize things. It’s really hard when someone doesn’t mind doing that and does it a lot.  AH: Sociopath.  Yeah.  AH: Yeah.  It is.  AH: I tend to ...  That’s the technical term for what’s going on, but go ahead.  AH: I mean he is, right? I tend to just get in the fetal position and watch Rachel Maddow and pretend that she’s stroking my forehead and telling me it’s going to be okay, but I also I do watch Fox every once in a while because I want to know what people are hearing, and I want to empathize with them and understand how they could believe this thing. I think it also helps a little that I grew up in a cult because I understand cult behavior.  But that’s another story.  AH: Totally other story. I’m fascinated by it. So you can sell almost anything to almost ... To anyone. There’s not one person depending on how much they make or what their worth is, all of that, can be sold something. My opinion of Trump is what it is, but beyond that, the reason, the fact that he was able to tap into a certain group like this, people are upset because of this, the cover, is it GQ [Esquire] with the American Boy cover? People are really upset about that.  I’m actually like, I want to read this. I understand where they’re coming from, and idealistic for me is us all working together, and all living together and having parity. It’s not like black people take over the world, which would be still a cool party. Cool party. But it’s not that. It’s, I have this idealistic view of things. So I want to understand, and I think that’s ... we’re just curious people.  I think the right plays the left all the time because the left always goes, “Oh, I want to understand.” The right’s like ... They do not want to ... We get played every day of the freaking week by them.  AH: But I want to know the same way I learned all the rules of venture capital so I could break them if I needed to. I want to know what people are hearing.  Sure. But I think they do go, “I’m a nice person.” Like, I don’t care. You’re still doing horrible things to the country.  AH: Sure, sure.  That’s the move. And the progressives tend to go leaning in and then bang. I’m a little bit more no, I’m not leaning into you people at all. I just don’t ...  AH: I’m still there. I’m still at the place where I kind of I want to learn a little bit.  Wendy, what do you think?  WD: Well, it’s a really good question because it’s, I think, one of the most important questions we need to grapple with, and one of the hardest ones to figure out what the answer is. Probably everyone in this room has someone in their family who has been, and I believe this, brainwashed by Fox News.  My brother, who I grew up with — of course I grew up with him, he’s my brother — but I have three siblings and he’s only 15 months older than I am, and we were so close growing up. We grew up in the same family with the same struggles, and my brother moved away to Tennessee, and he started watching Fox News, and I don’t even know him anymore. I love him so much, and it breaks my heart.  I got one of those.  WD: How did this happen? How does he see the world so differently than me? And if I can figure out how to crack that code with my brother, then maybe I can give a better answer to the question.  Is he trying to crack the code with you on the other side?  WD: No.  No. Exactly.  WD: No.  Let me just tell you, I don’t think we should try to get along. I just think we should win. That’s all. I don’t know. Part of me is ... I know it sounds terrible.  AH: It’s not terrible, it’s the quality of life. We only have a certain amount of years on this earth.  Yeah. I know.  AH: And the quality of life that I want to enjoy is always having tried.  I just wrote a column in the Times about having a stroke , which I had seven years ago.  AH: It was a great article.  And one of the things I said is, I just don’t have time for this. No. You don’t get to get away with it, and you don’t have time to be so fucked up about whatever you’re doing on social media or whatever. But one of the things that happened with me just recently, Tucker Carlson went after me for some reason, that guy.  WD: Badge of honor, badge of honor.  That’s not a badge of honor. He’s such a jackass. But he went after me, and he goes, “Kara Swisher, the elitist who went to private schools and this and that, and she’s untalented,” and my mom who watches Fox News and watches Tucker Carlson.  First of all, Tucker Carlson went to ... I checked into it and did the reporting. He went to a private school that was seven times more expensive than my private school and went to a more expensive college, and I was like, “You are so much more elitist than I was.” I mean, I’m elitist, sure, but it was a really interesting thing.  And what got my mom, though, was she goes, “Well, you’re not un talented. That’s just not true,” and I go, “You know, maybe the things they’re telling you are just not true .” It was an interesting moment.  Anyway, last quick question. Anybody else? Right here, very quick.  Audience member: What are you saying to the young people or kids that you have about some of the xenophobic, homophobic people they might come across, how you pay it forward. How are you teaching them to be more ...  That’s a great question.  Audience member: … to have more humility?  Go ahead, you two.  WD: They teach me, truly. They are so deeply rooted in a value that understands and fights against that as wrong, and they are leading the way with just a little bit of guidance from me in how they’re moving that value and that voice to a conversation that names it, that shames it, and that ultimately is going to overcome it or at least overcome it in a way that allows us to regain the kind of power that can suppress it and put it back into that closet that it was in before Donald Trump let it out, and everybody started wearing it loud and proud, as they do right now.  Arlan, last word?  AH: I’ll leave it at that since you work on such a great nonprofit.  Do you feel good about Gen Z? I do. I have two Gen Z kids.  AH: Oh, yeah.  WD: 100 percent.  AH: I used to be afraid of teenagers, and a teenager can still cut me a certain way by looking at me like I’m not cool, but man, I’m so impressed. I met so many teenagers recently who have been following what we’re doing, and I’m just like, when I get old it’s going to be awesome because you’re to be there. It’s so great. You’re going to take care of me. I’m really stoked. I’m really stoked.  On that note, Arlan Hamilton, Wendy Davis.

Natasha Lomas,technology,"                        Flipkart ranked highly for ‘fairness’ of working conditions in India gig platform study     Natasha Lomas   @riptari  / 9 hours         The Oxford Internet Institute has published what it bills as the world’s first rating system for working conditions on gig economy platforms.  The Fairwork academic research project is a collaboration with the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, the University of Cape Town, the University of Manchester, and the University of the Western Cape.  As the name suggests, the project focuses on conditions for workers who are being remotely managed by online platforms and their algorithms — creating a framework to score tech firms on factors like whether they pay gig economy workers the minimum wage and ensure their health and safety at work.  The two initial markets selected for piloting the rating system are India and South Africa, and the first batch of gig economy firms ranked includes a mix of delivery, ride-hailing and freelance work platforms, among others.  The plan is to update the rating yearly, and to also add gig economy platforms operating in the UK and Germany next year.  Fairness, rated  Fairwork’s gig platform scoring system measures performance per market across five standards — which are neatly condensed as: Fair pay, fair conditions, fair contracts, fair management, and fair representation.  Platforms are scored on each performance measure with a basic point and an advanced point, culminating in an overall score. (There’s more on the scoring methodology here .)  Most of the measures are self explanatory but the emphasis on fair contracts is for T&Cs to be “transparent, concise, and provided to workers in an accessible form”, with the contacting party subject to local law and identified in the contract.  While, in instances of what those behind the project dub “genuine” self-employment, terms of service must be free of clauses that “unreasonably exclude liability” on the part of the platform.  For fair management, a good rating demands a documented process and clear channel of communication through which workers can be heard; decisions can be appealed; and workers be informed of the reasons behind the decisions.  The use of any decision-making algorithms must also be transparent and result in “equitable outcomes for workers”. And there must also be identified and document policy to ensure equity in areas such as hiring and firing, while any data collection must be documented with a clear purpose and explicit informed consent.  Fair representation calls for platforms to allow workers to organize in collective bodies regardless of their employment status and be prepared to negotiate and co-operate with them.  Critical attention  Criticism of the so called ‘gig economy’ has dialled up in recent years, in Western markets especially, as the ‘flexible’ working claims platforms trumpet have attracted closer and more critical scrutiny .  Policymakers are acting on concerns that demand for casual labor is being exploited by increasingly powerful tech firms which are applying algorithms at scale while using self-serving employment classifications designed to workaround traditional labor rights so they can micromanage large-scale workforces remotely while sidestepping the costs of actually employing so many people.  Trenchant critics liken the result to a kind of modern day slavery — arguing that rights-denuded platform workers are part of a wider beaten down ‘precariat’.  A report last year by a UK MP was more nuanced but still likened the casual labor practices on UK startup Deliveroo’s food delivery platform to the kind of dual market seen in 20th century dockyards , suggesting that while the platform could work well for some gigging riders this was at the exploitative expense of others who were not preferred for jobs in the same way — with a risk of unpredictable and unstable earnings.  In recent years a number of unions have stepped up activity to support contract and casual workers used by the sector, as the number of platform workers has grown. Even as gig platforms have generally continued to deny granting collective bargaining to their ‘self-employed’ workers.  Against this backdrop there have also been a number of wildcat style ‘strikes’ by gig economy workers in the UK triggered by sudden changes to pricing policies and/or conditions, or focused more broadly on trying to move the needle on pay and working conditions .  A UK union-backed attempt to use European human rights law to challenge Deliveroo’s refusal to grant collective bargaining rights for couriers was dismissed by the High Court at the end of last year . Though the union vowed to appeal.  Regardless of that particular set-back, pressure from policymakers and the publicity from legal challenges attached to workers rights have yielded a number of improvements for gig workers in Europe, with — for example — Uber announcing it would expand free insurance products for drivers across much of the region last year . And it’s clear that scrutiny of platforms is an important lever for improving conditions for workers.  It’s with that in mind that the researchers behind Fairwork have launched their rating system.  “The Fairwork rating system shines a light on best and worst practice in the platform economy,” said Mark Graham, professor of Internet geography at the University of Oxford, commenting in a statement. “This is an area in which for too long, very few regulations have been in place to protect workers. These ratings will enable consumers to make informed choices about the platforms and services they need when ordering a cab, a takeaway or outsourcing a simple task.”  “Our hope is that our five areas of fairness will take a life of their own, and that workers, platforms and other advocates will start using them to improve the working conditions across the platform economy,” he added.  And now to those first year scores in India and South Africa…  Best and worst performers  In India, ecommerce giant Flipkart came out on top of the companies ranked, with its delivery and logistics arm eKart scoring 7/10.  Though — if it wants to get a perfect 10 — it’s still got work to do on contracts, to improve clarity and ensure they reflect the true nature of the relationship, according to the researchers’ assessment.  Flipkart also does not recognize a body that could support collective bargaining for its workers.  Three tech platforms shared the wooden spoon for the worst conditions for Indian gig workers, according to the researchers’ assessment — namely: Food delivery platform Foodpanda and ride-hailing giants Ola and Uber which scored just 2/10 apiece, fulfilling only the minimum wage criteria and failing on every other measure.  UberEats, Uber’s food delivery operation, did slightly better — scoring 3/10 in India, thanks to also offering a due process for decisions affecting workers.  While in South Africa the top scorer was white collar work platform NoSweat, which got 8/10. On the improvements front, it also could do a little more work to make its contracts fairer, and also doesn’t recognize collective bargaining.  Bottom of the list in the country is ride-hailing firm Bolt (Taxify) — which scored 4/10, hitting targets on pay and some conditions (mitigating task-specific risks), while also offering a due process for decisions affecting workers, but failing on other performance measures.  Uber didn’t do much better in South Africa either — coming in second to last, with 5/10. Though it’s notable the company does offer more protections for workers there vs those grafting on its platform in India, including mitigating task-specific risks and actively seeking to improve conditions (such as by offering insurance).  Reached for comment on its Fairwork ratings, an Uber spokesperson sent this statement:  Uber wouldn’t be what it is without drivers — they are at the heart of the Uber experience. Over the past years we have made a number of changes to offer a better experience with more support and more protection, including our Partner Injury Protection programme, new safety features and access to quality and affordable private healthcare coverage for driver-partners and their families. We will continue to work hard to earn our partners trust and ensure that their voices are heard as we take Uber forward together.  There’s clearly no one universal standard for Uber’s business where working conditions are concerned. Instead the company tunes its standard to the local regulatory climate — offering workers less where it believes it can get away with it.  That too suggests a stronger spotlight on conditions offered by gig economy platforms can help improve workers’ lot and raise standards globally.  On the improvements front the Fairwork researchers claim the project has already led to positive impacts in the two pilot markets — claiming discussions are “ongoing” with platforms in India about implementing changes in line with the principles, including with a platform that has some 450,000 workers.  Though they also point out the first-year ranking show the overwhelming majority of India’s platform workers are engaged on platforms that score below their Fairwork basic standards (with scores <5/10) — which covers more than a million gig economy workers.  In South Africa another positive development they point to is alcohol delivery platform Bottles committing to supporting the emergence of fair workers’ representation on its platform, after collaborating with the project.  The local NoSweat freelance work platform has also introduced what the researchers couch as “significant changes” in all five areas of fairness — now having a formal policy to pay over the minimum wage after workers’ costs are taken into account; a clear process to ensure clients on the platform agree to protect workers’ health and safety; and a channel and process for workers to lodge grievance about conditions.  Commenting in a statement, Wilfred Greyling, co-founder of NoSweat said the project had helped the company “formalise” the principles and incorporate them into its systems. “NoSweat Work believes firmly in a fair deal for all parties involved in any work we put out,” he said, adding that the platform is “built on people and relationships; we never hide behind faceless technology”.  This report was updated with comment from Uber                        ","The Oxford Internet Institute has published what it bills as the world’s first rating system for working conditions on gig economy platforms.

Alex Bainter,technology,"Homepage Homepage Music Become a member Sign in Get started Generating More of My Favorite Aphex Twin Track Have you ever heard a song you liked so much you wished it would last forever? Alex Bainter Blocked Unblock Follow Following Nov 5, 2018 Take a moment to listen if you’ve never heard this before. “aisatsana” is the final track off Aphex Twin’s 2012 release, Syro . A departure from the synthy dance tunes which make up the majority of Aphex Twin’s catalog, aisatsana is quiet, calm, and perfect for listening to during activities which require concentration. But with a measly running time just shy of five and a half minutes, the track isn’t nearly long enough to sustain a session of reading or coding. Playing the track on repeat isn’t satisfactory; exact repetition becomes monotonous quickly. I wished there were an hour-long version of the track, or even better, some system which could generate an endless performance of the track without repetition. Since I build software for a living, I decided to try creating such a system. Musical Structure Allow me to explain the relatively simple structure of aisatsana. If you’re not familiar with music theory, I’ll do my best to define the terms I’ll be using and avoid any that aren’t necessary. Try not to get hung up on the vocabulary though. A beat is an abstract unit of time. For example, I could tell you to snap your fingers on beats one and three, and clap your hands on beats two and four, and the resulting song would go snap, clap, snap, clap . The speed at which a song is played can be measured in beats per minute, or BPM . If I told you to play that same song at 60 BPM (or one beat per second), you’d either be snapping or clapping with each tick of a clock, and it would take four seconds to play the whole song. aisatsana is played at 102 BPM. aisatsana follows a very simple pattern. If you start counting at the first note, every 16 beats contains a sequence of notes, which I call a phrase . For example, from 3 seconds to 12 seconds contains one phrase, and from 12 seconds to 21 seconds contains another phrase. The piece continues to play a new phrase every 16 beats until the end, for a total of 32 phrases. This is much simpler than most examples of popular music, which usually have markedly different sections like the chorus, verses, and maybe a bridge or a pre-chorus. With this perspective, one could describe aisatsana succinctly as an algorithm: Every 16 beats, play a 16 beat phrase I think about this algorithm in two parts: Every 16 beats, do something. Play a 16 beat phrase. To create a system which could play aisatsana-like music endlessly, it would need to be able to fulfill these two requirements. Part one is easy (remember, a beat is just a unit of time, so it can be read as “every X seconds, do something ”). Part two is a little trickier. An Algorithm For Writing Music One totally valid strategy for making aisatsana last forever would be to separate the 32 phrases and write a program to select and play a phrase every 16 beats. The result would probably be nicely varied, and no doubt enjoyable to listen to for longer than simply playing the original track over and over. However, I feel this approach would still be too repetitive. My brain would learn to recognize all 32 phrases and the output of such a system would become boring. It was important to me that the system could create and play new phrases in addition to the original ones. The challenge was to generate new phrases which sounded similar to the originals; the system shouldn’t just play random notes for 16 beats. Ideally, someone who’d never heard aisatsana before could listen to my system without knowing which phrases were new and which were from the original track. I began researching methods for generating new music which was similar to some input. Naturally, I found many solutions which involved deep learning techniques. However, with a paltry sample size of 32 phrases, I was worried these techniques would require significantly more input than I had to offer. Instead, I decided to try an older technique which used Markov Chains . You can learn all about Markov chains with a quick internet search, but I’ll try to explain it with an example. A Markov chain records a set of possible states and the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. Let’s pretend in your whole life you only ever go to three places: your home, your workplace, and the grocery store. In this sad existence of yours there are three states: either you’re at home (state one), or you’re at your workplace (state two), or you’re at the grocery store (state three). If I were creepy, I could follow you around for some time and record where you go. Eventually, I could analyze my data to determine the probability of where you’ll go next based on where you currently are. For example, perhaps I’ve observed that when you’re at home there’s an 80% chance the next place you’ll go is your workplace, and a 20% the next place you’ll go is the grocery store. When you’re at work, there’s a 50% chance you’ll next go to the grocery store and a 50% chance you’ll go home. Finally, when you’re at the grocery store, there’s a 95% chance you’ll go home next and only a 5% chance you’ll go to work next. This is all that’s needed to create a Markov chain: states, and the probabilities of transitioning from each state to the others. I’ll apply this to music with a simple example. Below I’ve drawn out two four-beat phrases in standard musical notation. I’ve also written the note names next to each note and the beat count at the top in case you don’t read music. So to play phrase one, you’d play an A on beat one, an F on beat two, an A again on beat three, and an F again on beat four. To play phrase two, you’d play an E on beat one, a C on beat two, an A on beat three, and a C on beat four. Easy! Let’s build a Markov chain to describe these two phrases. For the state names, I’ll use a combination of the beat and the note, like 1A to describe an A played on beat one. I’m also going to add a start and an end state to denote the beginning and end of a phrase. I’ll use an arrow (→) to denote a transition from one state to another. In this notation, phrase one is start → 1A→2F→3A→4F→end and phrase two is start→1E→2C→3A→4C → end . There are 9 states: start, 1A, 1E, 2F, 2C, 3A, 4F, 4C, and end, and here are the probabilities for each transition: start→1A : 50% start→1E :  50% 1A→2F : 100% 1E→2C : 100% 2F→3A : 100% 2C→3A : 100% 3A→4F : 50% 3A→4C : 50% 4F→end :  100% 4C→end :  100% With this Markov chain, we can generate phrases by beginning at start and following the transitions until we reach end . This is called walking the chain . Walking the chain Here’s an algorithm for walking this Markov chain: Begin at start . Record the current state. Select one of the transitions from the current state based on the probability of each transition, and follow that transition to the next state. Repeat step 2 until you’ve reached end . Let’s generate a phrase. Beginning at start , there’s a 50% chance of transitioning to 1A and a 50% chance of transitioning to 1E . I’ll flip a coin; heads, we go to 1A , tails, we go to 1E . Golly, it landed heads, so now we’re at 1A. So far the phrase we’re generating looks like start→1A. 1A always transitions to 2F , so now we have start→1A→2F . Again, we can see that 2F always transitions to 3A , which puts us at start→1A→2F→3A . Here’s where things get interesting. 3A has a 50% chance of transitioning to 4F and a 50% chance of transitioning to 4C. I could flip another coin to determine which state we select; let’s say heads means we go to 4F and tails means we go to 4C . If I flip a coin and it lands on heads, we’ll have generated a copy of the first original phrase ( start→1A→2F→3A→4F→end ). But if the coin lands on tails, we’ll have generated a new phrase: start → 1A→2F→3A→4C→end ! If we take every possible path through our Markov chain, we’ll see it’s capable of generating four phrases: start→1A→2F→3A→4F→end (original phrase one) start→1A→2F→3A→4C→end (new phrase) start→1E→2C→3A→4C→end (original phrase two) start→1E→2C→3A→4F→end (new phrase) Look at that! The Markov chain helped us generate two new phrases. If we played all four phrases in a row to someone who had never heard any of them, that person probably wouldn’t be able to tell which ones were original and which were new. The phrases sound similar to each other because they were all built from the same Markov chain. This strategy can be applied to aisatsana as well with a much larger Markov chain. This small example only has two phrases, and each only contains four beats. aisatsana has 32 phrases, each made up of 16 beats. Even though there will be more states and transitions, you can go through the exact same process of building and walking a Markov chain to generate phrases both new and original. Building the Chain The first thing I needed was a digital representation of aisatsana to work with. While our little example above was easy to calculate and walk by hand, doing the same with aisatsana would take a very long time. Note that an audio file wouldn’t work; I needed the actual instructions for playing the piece, like which notes are played and when. This is precisely what MIDI files are for, and the very nice folks who run the MIDM Database have a MIDI file for aisatsana ! I wanted my system to run in the browser, so I decided to build my system in JavaScript. While one could parse a MIDI file with JavaScript, I preferred to work with something in a JSON format, and found a tool online to make the conversion for me . You can view the JSON output from the conversion here . If you examine the JSON file above, you’ll see a property named tracks which is an array containing three objects, one of which has a non-empty property notes . notes is an array of objects, each of which includes a note name and the time in seconds at which the note is to be played. This is exactly the information needed to build a Markov chain! Quick NOTE  (heh…): the note names in the JSON linked above are all a letter followed by a number, like “G3.” It’s not important that you understand what the number means, just understand that a letter followed by a number indicates a more specific note than a letter by itself.  If you’re curious, the number indicates the octave in which the note is played. At this point, I must confess that there’s a small difference between aisatsana and the phrases I used in the example above which affected how I built the Markov chain. In my example phrases, every note occurred on one of the beats. However, this isn’t the case in aisatsana. Some of the notes occur halfway between two beats. There’s two ways one could adjust the chain-building strategy to account for this: Treat aisatsana as if it were played at 204 BPM, which is double the actual speed. This would mean each phrase is made of 32 beats instead of 16. Count “half-beats” instead of beats. The implementations are identical, but I’ll continue writing from the perspective of the latter approach. To build the Markov chain, I needed to know which half-beat each note is played on. The output of the MIDI file unfortunately doesn’t indicate this information, but it does include the time of each note in seconds. Since we know the speed of the track is 102 BPM ( beats per minute , remember?), we can easily calculate the length of each half-beat. To do this, simply convert 102 BPM to seconds per half-beat . First, change 102 BPM to half-beats per minute : 102 beats per minute multiplied by 2 half-beats per beat equals 204 half-beats per minute Then, convert it to seconds per half-beat : 60 seconds per minute divided by 204 half-beats per minute equals about 0.29 seconds per half-beat Now it’s easy to determine which half-beat each note occurs on. For example, any note played between 0 and 0.29 seconds can be attributed to the first half-beat. Notes played between 0.29 and 0.58 seconds are attributed to the second half-beat, and so on. Just iterate through the array of notes to determine which half-beat each note occurs on. In music production this process is called quantization . Once the notes were quantized, I separated them into the aforementioned 32 phrases. Since each phrase is made of 32 half-beats (or 16 beats), this is a trivial process. All that was left to do was create the Markov chain. In my implementation (which I’ll link below), to denote the states I used a combination of the half-beat number relative to the phrase and the notes played during that half-beat. For example, 1,C4,A4 indicates a C4 and an A4 played during half-beat 1 of the phrase. If no notes were played during the half-beat, I simply used the half-beat number, like 3 . Each phrase includes 32 states, all starting with a number between 1 and 32. If you recall the notation I used earlier, a phrase of aisatsana might be represented like start→1,C4,A4→2→3,G5→4→ …(and so on)… →30→31,C4→32→end . With all of the phrases converted into state names, I was ready to calculate the transition probabilities. While many software developers abide by the DRY principle (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”), I feel it’s just as important to adhere to DRO (“Don’t Repeat Others”) when possible. I found a library on npm appropriately named “ markov-chains ” which could take my phrases as input and also provided a .walk() function which returns a list of states created by walking the chain. This enabled my system to generate new and original phrases of aisatsana. I found a collection free piano samples in the wonderful Community Edition of Versilian Studios Chamber Orchestra 2 , and I could play them through the Web Audio API with the equally amazing Tone.js . Thus, the “play a 16 beat phrase” requirement of the algorithm I mentioned at the beginning of this article was fulfilled, and my dream system was complete. Generative Music You can listen to my implementation on generative.fm as long as you’re using a browser which supports the Web Audio API , which you probably are. On the site, select “aisatsana (generative remix),” and then press play. If you’d like to inspect the code for yourself, you can find it in a Github repository here . I am incredibly pleased with the result. All of the phrases sound like they belong in the same piece, and the playback is sufficiently random so as not to be tiresome. In fact, the system is capable of generating over four million unique phrases, which is enough to play for over 451 days without playing the same phrase twice. I often listen to the output from this system for several hours at a time, especially when I’m coding, reading, or writing (I’m listening to it as I type this). An interesting transformation took place during this process. The original piece of music is static. It has a beginning and an end, and everything in between is specified in a particular order. Every time you listen to the recording or hear it performed live, the same piece of music is played, even if it’s performed remotely on a grand piano swinging across a stage like a pendulum . Through the process outlined in this article, a system has been created which generates new music on demand. This system will play for as long as you’re willing to listen, but never repeat itself in any discernible way. It will invent a new sequence of phrases to play every time it starts. In other words, you’ll never hear it play the same thing twice. I don’t feel this is better or worse than the original, but it’s profoundly different. Creating systems to generate music is not new. Brian Eno created several such systems and coined the term “generative music” to describe their output. He was inspired by composers like Steve Reich, who had also experimented with generative music systems. You can find an unbelievably fantastic overview of generative music by Tero Parviainen at teropa.info/loop . You can also read my own “ Introduction to Generative Music .” It’s truly incredible that we can create unique, complex musical output from simple systems which run on your smartphone’s internet browser. With the accessibility of technologies like the Web Audio API and deep learning libraries, I look forward to a future full of amazing musical systems unbound by the limitations of traditionally written and recorded music. If you enjoy listening to my generative version of aisatsana, you might be interested in some of my other generative music systems. You can listen to them all at generative.fm . I find this music is perfect for listening to during flow -based activities which require concentration, like reading, writing, coding, and working.

Insights  Gibraltar  Cryptocurrency  Wallet  Fiat money  Mobile app  blockchain   ‘First cryptocurrency football club’ is still paying players’ salaries in fiat  Gibraltar United yet to see through on its promise                            Story by  Matthew Beedham       67  Shares                Contrary to what was promised last year, semi-professional football team Gibraltar United is still not paying its players in cryptocurrency.  In July 2018, The Guardian reported the Gibraltar Premier division team will be the first one to “pay players in cryptocurrency.” Club founder and majority owner, Pablo Dana, said all player contracts will include payment agreements in cryptocurrency by next season.     “All players and staff will be requested to open a digital wallet and they will be able to choose to receive their salaries in fiat or QTC [Quantocoin],” a Gibraltar United spokesperson told Hard Fork in an email last August. “This said all future bonuses will exclusively be paid in crypto.”  Indeed, there were even plans to integrate cryptocurrency payments into other clubs owned by Dana. “This will also be the case for the other teams where [Dana’s holding] is a shareholder in Italy, Spain and Portugal,” the spokesperson added. “Gibraltar is the starter. We announced this already back in January this year that the start of the 2018-2019 season would see the team adopt the cryptocurrency.”  Despite these lofty ambitions though, the season is nearing its end and there is still no sign that players are receiving their salaries in digital assets.  What happened?  The plan was to manage players’ payroll with an app called Quantocoin. To receive salaries in cryptocurrency, players would have to download the app and open a wallet, where they could receive Quantocoin’s native token, QTC. Claiming to be a “blockchain bank,” Dana told Hard Fork in August that players would be able to convert QTC tokens into other cryptocurrencies (and perhaps even fiat) directly from the app.  This model, Dana said, would help players avoid some of the challenges they face when setting up local bank accounts. Quantocoin thought it could help players by providing an alternative banking platform.  “Once the players receive the QTCt, they can change them into altcoins or fiat at their own wish,” Dana told Hard Fork when the news first dropped. “QTCt shall be on major exchanges within days,” he added.  That was back in August, 2018. Eight months later, QTCt is yet to start trading on any cryptocurrency exchanges. This means that even if the salaries and bonuses were distributed in cryptocurrency, players would have no easy way of using them outside of the Quantocoin app – let alone converting them to fiat.  It should also be noted that Dana is a major investor in Quantocoin and is listed on its website as one its “key people.” He clearly stands to benefit if Quantocoin becomes popular.   At press time, Quantocoin claims to be in the final stage of its initial coin offering (ICO), which it has branded as a distributional token offering (DTO). This appears to be the only way of acquiring tokens, yet there is nowhere to actively trade them.  The update  Hard Fork contacted staff and players at Gibraltar United to find out when, or if at all, players could expect to be paid in cryptocurrency.  One player confirmed to Hard Fork that neither he, nor anyone else in the team, has received any salary or bonus payments in cryptocurrency to date.  “There is an agreement in place to receive prize money or bonuses in Quantocoin,” the player continued. “Once the app is fully running we will also have the option to get paid in Quantocoin or in normal currency as we are now.”  While the Quantocoin app is available on Google play, it has not been updated since it launched last June and has had barely any downloads; just 50 at the time of writing.               The player didn’t know when it would be fully functional. While there is an “agreement” for players to receive prize money or bonuses in cryptocurrency, none of them have actually received any.  Even so, the player believes the team is “keen on bonuses [being] paid in crypto as it’s a growing thing in Gibraltar.”  Hard Fork contacted Dana to inquire about Quantocoin’s status, but the Gibraltar United president declined to comment on both occasions.  “We lost enough time with you,” Dana told us, referring to a previous line of inquiry Hard Fork initiated back in August, when Gibraltar United first made headlines with its intention to pay players in cryptocurrency.  At the time, Dana boasted Gibraltar United will be the first football club in the world to integrate cryptocurrency payments for salaries and bonuses. Indeed, the announcement attracted coverage from a number of outlets, including CCN and Bitcoin.com , among many others.  As we already mentioned, the news even made it to The Guardian.  But for all the press Gibraltar United received, the club has yet to deliver on its promises.  A familiar story  Last year, a similar story came to light after reports suggested Argentina would be getting 1,600 Bitcoin ATMs before the end of 2019 , 150 of which would be installed by the end of 2018. However, months later after being contacted by Hard Fork the Bitcoin ATM operator, Odyssey, began backtracking on its promises.  Odyssey had previously said that it had installed 200 BATMs in Argentina in 2017, but months later, retreated on promises when questioned.  The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry relies heavily on making promises of what the future will be like if these promises come to fruition. In many cases, Gibraltar United included, it’s these visions that are being sold , rather than a working technology.  Last August, Dana told Hard Fork he believes blockchain has lots to offer to the sports industry.  “Football must become more transparent and less corrupted, and blockchain is the right way to showcase this reality,” he said. “For us, it is a fabulous opportunity to lead the way and finally bring real transparency to the table.”  He also predicted that we’re close to mass adoption, and we will all be getting paid in cryptocurrency soon enough – without any need to convert our salaries to fiat.  Asked about when he foresees cryptocurrencies will hit the mainstream, he responded confidently: “24 months.”  Additional reporting by Mix  Did you know?

Brian Heater,technology,"                        EU calls for increased security, but doesn’t ban Huawei 5G products     Brian Heater   @bheater  / 10 hours         The European Union’s current approach to potential cybersecurity threats posed by Huawei 5G products is caution, but not an outright ban. The topic was the subject of new recommendations issued by the EU this week in response to U.S. calls to boycott the electronics giant over fears around its connection to the Chinese government.  The report rightly notes that coming 5G technologies will form the backbone of some of society’s most foundational elements, from banking, to transportation, health, industry and even democracies. But it stops short of suggesting a similar outright ban to the one implemented by the U.S. government.  ”5G technology will transform our economy and society and open massive opportunities for people and businesses,” European digital chief Andrus Ansip said in a statement tied to the recommendation. “But we cannot accept this happening without full security built in. It is therefore essential that 5G infrastructures in the EU are resilient and fully secure from technical or legal backdoors.”  The language certainly doesn’t close the door to an outright ban moving forward, as the EU looks to increase scrutiny around these technologies, but it does mark part of a larger trend to push back on the U.S. government’s calls for blanket bans.  Addressing a telecoms conference in Barcelona last month European digital commissioner Mariya Gabriel said Europe must have “a common approach” to the challenge of network security, warning there is a risk of fragmentation if Member States take diverging decisions “trying to protect themselves”.  She said at the time that the Commission was preparing to take steps soon — but did not speak up in favor of an outright ban, also leaving the door open to a softer approach.

That's enough to get me to rethink my credit card allegiances. The promise of privacy and empowerment over our finances sounds like a fresh take on banking. I'm ready for a smart credit card in 2019. Yes, there's a bit of vertical domination to it. Apple would be part of my transactions, from start to finish, from my building credit to buy the iPhone 11 , to storing all of my data via iCloud, to trading the phone in for store credit toward the 2020 iPhone. But, of all of the products Apple announced at its March 25 event – Apple TV Plus , Apple News Plus , and Apple Arcade – the Apple Card was the surprise highlight that has the potential to be industry-changing and, for some, life-changing. Here are the privacy reasons why the Apple Card, launching in the middle of this year, has a future in my physical wallet and Wallet app. 1. Privacy pledge in a data-hungry world No surprise, Apple is promising to keep your credit card transaction data private and financial information secure. Privacy has become Apple's mantra. Image credit: Apple What may surprise you is how many credit card companies sell your personal data and how truly limited you are to opt out. When you can opt out, it's often difficult to do, buried in a super-sub-menu or requires calling a obscured phone number. Apple declares, right on its site in big, playful text, ""Even Apple doesn’t know what you bought. Or where. Or how much you paid,"" and says of issuing banking partner Goldman Sachs, ""they will never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising."" So far, so good. 2. That titanium Apple Card – with no numbers This is brilliant. There are no numbers printed on the Apple-designed titanium card. Its laser-etched with your name, and the Apple and the MasterCard logos. That's it. Image credit: Apple Contrast that with my current credit card, with worn, but still visible numbers. In the US, your credit card numbers are fairly exposed. They sit there on a table as you wait for your card and bill to be collected at a restaurant or bar, and then a server takes them to the back to run the transaction at a terminal. If you credit card gets stolen, the thief has access to your numbers for much longer. This sort of credit card theft is rare, but it's happened to me – and it's a headache to deal with. Any time your card is out of sight, you're at risk. Apple keeps the numbers locked to the Wallet app in your iPhone. 3. Colorful, ad-free spending summaries My credit card company has basic categorized spend tracking three menus deep and it's not very good, so I've used personal financial management service Mint.com... only to be inundated with ads trying to sell me stuff. It's colorful and fully detailed, sure, but I have to log into Mint, separate from my credit card account, and dodge unsolicited offers at every turn. I've used Mint alternatives, but nothing has impressed me. Image credit: Apple Apple Card uses simple weekly and monthly summaries right inside the Wallet app. It's colorful looking, yet devoid of the ads I'm used to seeing. Categories are broken down by color, and those are reflected in the trend bars when you look over your spending history. Simple and colorful, it looks like the Apple Activity app, but for exercising my financial muscle. Best of all, no one's trying to sell me stuff based on my financial details. Other intriguing Apple Card ideas Daily Cash: I like this idea of up to 3% back on Apple purchases (from the Apple Store and also the App Store and iTunes), 2% back on all Apple Pay transactions, and 1% on everything else – and it goes right in my Apple Cash account so I can spend it daily. There are other cards with as much as 5% cash back at their stores (Amazon is one), but it all depends on how much you shop at specific stores vs use Apple Pay. Interest calculator: This is something I could have used when I was younger. It spells out how much interest you'd pay if you can't pay everything on your card. It's way more upfront with this information than I've experienced with other credit cards. Payments due on the last day of the month: It's not set for random a date you always forget, and the Wallet app has a payments daily countdown to your next bill. There are also push notifications. I feel like the credit card companies I've used in the past didn't want me know this information. No international or annual fees : My current credit card dings me every time I make a transaction during MWC in Barcelona or when I'm on any other international trip. The rival card I wanted to switch to (before today) doesn't have this, but does have an annual fee. The Apple Card doesn't have fees – except for interest fees (higher than the average, but okay with me, as I make payments on time). Apple Maps location data: This tracks down where your Point of Sale happened. No more having to Google why you made a transaction at POS 10138604. The days of sleuthing my way through making sense of my my credit card statement are over. Image credit: Apple Financial companies, I've learned, are not tech companies. Their web and app-based payment and tracking methods are often outdated and confusing (sometimes, it seems to be on purpose). And sure, Apple is technology company, not a financial company, but after plenty of experience with deceptively marketed credit cards, I'm willing to take a chance on something new to disrupt payments and my privacy. If it proves popular, the Apple Card could push the industry to be more responsible. 3 things we want to know about Apple Arcade, the new gaming service   See more Mobile phones news           Tech deals, prizes and latest news     Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Sarah Perez,technology,"                        Mozilla’s free password manager, Firefox Lockbox, launches on Android     Sarah Perez   @sarahintampa  / 9 hours         Mozilla’s free password manager designed for users of the Firefox web browser is today officially arriving on Android . The standalone app, called Firefox Lockbox , offers a simple if a bit basic way for users to access their logins already stored in their Firefox browser from their mobile device.  The app is nowhere near as developed as password managers like 1Password, Dashlane, LastPass and others as it lacks common features like the ability to add, edit or delete passwords; suggest complex passwords; or alert you to potentially compromised passwords resulting from data breaches, among other things.  However, the app is free – and if you’re already using Firefox’s browser, it’s at the very least a more secure alternative to writing down your passwords into an unprotected notepad app, for example. And you can opt to enable Lockbox as an Autofill service on Android.   But the app is really just a companion to Firefox. The passwords in Lockbox securely sync to the app from the Firefox browser – they aren’t entered by hand. For security, the app can be locked with facial recognition or a fingerprint (depending on device support). The passwords are also encrypted in a way that doesn’t allow Mozilla to read your data, it explains in a FAQ .  Firefox Lockbox is now one of several projects Mozilla developed through its now-shuttered Test Flight program. Over a few years’ time, the program had allowed the organization to trial more experimental features – some of which made their way to official products, like the recently launched file sharing app, Firefox Send .  Others in the program – including Firefox Color⁩ , ⁨Side View⁩ , ⁨Firefox Notes⁩ , ⁨Price Tracker⁩ , and ⁨Email Tabs⁩ remain available, but are no longer actively developed beyond occasional maintenance releases. Mozilla’s current focus is on its suite of “privacy-first” solutions, not its other handy utilities.   According to Mozilla, Lockbox was downloaded over 50,000 times on iOS ahead of today’s Android launch.  The Android version is a free download on Google Play.

Huawei would have you believe that its new P30 Pro Android flagship is precisely that sort of no-compromise device. Announced at another gala event in Paris today, the P30 Pro addresses the few downsides of Huawei’s already excellent Mate 20 Pro from last year, and it adds a sophisticated new camera system that promises up to 10x lossless zoom. You won’t be able to buy it in a US carrier store, but this will still be one of the best-selling high-end devices across the globe this year. And probably one of the best.  Getting to grips with the P30 Pro is easy because it’s the same size, shape, and thickness as practically every other Android flagship phone on the market today. Putting this up alongside Samsung’s Galaxy S10 Plus , the handset Huawei hopes to outshine with the P30 Pro, the differences between them are minute. Huawei’s phone has a chin that’s about a millimeter thicker, and it features probably the world’s smallest notch to date, which is literally just a cutout for the camera. Huawei is omitting an earpiece on the P30 Pro, making innovative use of electromagnetic levitation to vibrate the top of the screen to generate call sound. That means there are no stereo speakers on this phone, and there are also more discreet phone calls because call sound will only propagate in one direction.              Photo: Vlad Savov / The Verge     My two biggest gripes about the Mate 20 Pro were its curved screen edges and the inconsistent in-display fingerprint sensor. The P30 Pro still has curved glass on both the front and back, but it’s a much gentler slope, something a lot closer in form to Samsung’s latest Galaxy S devices. I’m a fan of this subtler curvature both on Samsung and on Huawei’s phones. It achieves the intended softening of the edges of the device and makes for a prettier, more cohesive design, but it doesn’t deprive me of useful screen space. Huawei also says that its new in-display fingerprint scanner, which remains optical (as opposed to pressure-sensitive alternatives like Samsung’s ultrasonic one), is 30 percent faster than the one on the Mate 20 Pro.  Before getting lost in all of the details about Huawei’s new quad-camera system, it’s worth quickly noting the salient specs of the P30 Pro. This new phone is built around the 7nm Kirin 980 processor that Huawei designs itself, which I really enjoyed in my time reviewing the Mate 20 Pro and the Honor View 20 . It’s still a flagship-quality part, and it’ll remain so for the foreseeable future. Huawei will pair that with a typical 8GB of RAM and storage options from 128GB to 512GB.  The display is a 6.47-inch curved OLED panel with 2340 x 1080 resolution and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. On the inside, there’s a massive 4,200mAh battery, which can be topped up to 70 percent full in 30 minutes using Huawei’s 40W SuperCharge wired charging. The P30 Pro also supports 15W wireless charging as well as reverse wireless charging. So yes, you’ll be able to charge your Samsung Galaxy Buds off the back of this phone, if you wish.              Huawei is today also launching a non-Pro P30, which scales the screen size down to 6.1 inches, has a smaller 3,650mAh battery, and accepts slower 22.5W charging. The P30 Pro is IP68-certified certified for dust and water resistance, whereas the P30 only extends to IP53. That may or may not be because the P30 still has a headphone jack and an earpiece, both items that the Pro model lacks. The smaller phone will also have a simpler three-camera setup, omitting the periscope zoom and the fourth, depth-detecting sensor.                                                    The big deal with the P30 Pro is its new camera setup. Huawei’s breathless marketing will tell you that it’s “rewriting the rules” of mobile photography, and while I wouldn’t go quite that far, it really does look extremely promising. First, the subtle bit: Huawei’s built a new AI-driven HDR+ mode that creates an intelligent exposure map for the entire frame of a photo and then adjusts each section of the image. It will detect faces and landscape markers, such as grass or the sun, and treat each of them appropriately. This, along with some strikingly sharp and well-exposed sample photos I was able to shoot with the P30 Pro, gives me reason for optimism that Huawei has taken steps to bridge the gap between its cameras and Google’s supreme Pixel.    P30 Pro camera specs  Ultra wide angle: 20MP, 16mm, f/2.2  Main sensor: 40MP, 27mm, f/1.6, OIS  Telephoto: 8MP, 125mm, f/3.4, OIS  Time-of-flight (ToF) camera for depth detection  Selfie: 32MP with Super HDR Shot & Super Low Light Shot    Part of what might explain the apparent improvement in image quality I noticed in my first try with the P30 Pro is the new RYYB SuperSpectrum main camera sensor. It’s still a 40-megapixel sensor that defaults to producing 10-megapixel shots by combining four pixels into one, but each pixel is now different. Huawei has replaced the RGB sub-pixel arrangement with one featuring red, blue, and yellow color sensors. And since the yellow sensors will absorb both red and green light, Huawei says this new arrangement soaks up 40 percent more light than RGB, which leads to better, cleaner photos. The SuperSpectrum part is on both the P30 Pro and the P30.             Huawei P30 Pro (left) next to Huawei P30.     The reason for that big vertical slab of cameras on the back of the P30 Pro is, of course, this phone’s zoom capabilities. In order from top to bottom: you get an ultra wide angle lens for grand architecture or big group photos, the main camera, which is now augmented with optical image stabilization, and a new periscope zoom lens that offers 5x of optical zoom. Huawei claims that, by combining the image data from the main camera and the telephoto lens, the P30 Pro can produce a 10x lossless zoom. That’ll be something to test in a review.  In my brief testing, I was most impressed with Huawei’s time-of-flight (ToF) camera and the way it enhances portrait mode on this phone. Using the depth information from the ToF sensor, Huawei is much more precise about identifying its subject and neatly separating the person from the background. But the novelty now is that Huawei is also gradating the simulated bokeh in its portrait mode: the bokeh will be less pronounced closer to the subject and increasingly softer and blurrier as you get further away from it. What that means is that you won’t get the 2D cutout effect with portrait photos. You can see a couple of the sample shots I took in the hands-on video above. The great thing about them is they were my first tries. This camera evidently makes it easy to take good photos, and that’s what every phone camera should aspire to.  On the video front, Huawei is promising to add a Dual Video recording function that will shoot simultaneous video from both the main and the telephoto sensor, combining them into a single widescreen side-by-side video. This will come as part of a future software update.              If I haven’t made it obvious yet, I’m excited for the Huawei P30 Pro. Huawei, despite its clashes with US regulators and a chronic inability to keep its new phones secret, keeps improving at a rate that few other smartphone manufacturers can match. Questions around Huawei’s EMUI user experience and that new fingerprint sensor remain to be answered, but in terms of pure engineering firepower, the P30 Pro gives you about as much performance as you can ask for today.  Huawei is pricing the P30 Pro at €999 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or €1,099 for the 8GB / 256GB configuration, or €1,249 for 8GB / 512GB. The P30 will cost €799 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Both phones are going on sale immediately, and the P30 Pro is available in a new blue gradient color variation called Breathing Crystal, along with a Pearl White, an iridescent red called Amber Sunrise, Huawei’s signature Aurora, and a basic Black.

Lucas Matney,technology,"                        Apple News+ is a great deal, but what does ‘full access’ really mean?     Lucas Matney  8 hours         Curious whether you should cancel your existing magazine subscription and just subscribe to Apple News+?  Apple certainly seems to believe News+ is an outsized bargain for you. The company’s claim that it would cost users $8000 to get annual access to the publications they are giving readers for $9.99 per month suggests that they see News+ giving consumers the full value of of these publications’ subscriptions.  While you may have access to most of these publication’s editorial content, due to the curated nature of the platform, it still might be a challenge for you to actually see all of these stories as you scroll and click through the app. News+ is still a great bargain for consumers, but the company has done little to transparently communicate what the service is not.   Apple and individual publications (such as ours) struck their own deals. Terms were dictated in ways that probably made publishers believe that their wouldn’t be much attrition from core subscription products, but little of that matters when consumer perceptions aren’t managed.    So what does my $35/month @WSJ subscription give me that I can't get on Apple News Plus for $9.99/month.  I might have to cancel on WSJ if I can't get a good answer.  — Christopher N Esq. (@FarGreaterAsset) March 25, 2019   Apple doing little to convey what users won’t see when they open the News+ tab is unfortunate, but it’s far more detrimental to publications earnestly looking to expand their user bases, not cannibalize subscriptions. Complicated deal terms don’t make for the prettiest Keynote slides but if consumers are left to make their own assumptions, they’ll likely just assume what Apple has told them is the truth, that they are getting “full access.”  As a subscriber how are you supposed to know if your pricier Wall Street Journal digital subscription is any different from what is available on News+? Don’t look for fine print on the Apple News+ landing page, don’t look in the app itself, in fact, this information doesn’t seem to be available anywhere in Apple’s communications. The best rundown I’ve seen so far is this newsletter from CNN’s Brian Stelter, which suggests the paper is “trying to have it both ways,” letting News+ users access the full scope of the day’s content through search though much of it won’t organically surface from Apple’s curation and will only be available for a limited time. Most users signing up for News+ likely won’t realize this.   Apple unveils its $9.99 per month news subscription service, Apple News+   Though the minutiae of “full access” is somewhat unclear, Apple is better than most at distilling complicated deal terms into something snappy and I think it’s fair to say that non-print subscribers signing up for News+ will cancel existing subscriptions unless the reasons not to are thrown directly in their face by the publications.  Some are trying to do just that, but it’s not easy to surface caveats in the wake of a major Apple announcement.  The New Yorker’s Editor Michael Luo laid out some of the differences between what access full subscribers would be getting to the magazine’s content compared to News+ subscribers, and it seems to boil down to the fact that “most” web content isn’t included in the deal alongside some digital services like crossword puzzles.    1/ On this question of whether Apple News+ means you shouldn't subscribe directly to your favorite magazines any longer, here are a few things to think about: still the best way to read ALL that we do @newyorker every day and every week is to subscribe. https://t.co/c3uJ7pha5Q  — Michael Luo (@michaelluo) March 26, 2019   A journalist’s thread with a dozen or so retweets won’t achieve the reach that Apple can, and the underlying points embody the frustrations that Apple seemed to implicitly suggest News+ was a total replacement for these publications’ subscriptions when they juxtaposed the massive $8000 per year slide with the $9.99 monthly price of News+.  While plenty of these publications are seemingly stuck in News+ for the time being thanks to the initial terms of the Texture acquisition (which served as the basis for Apple’s new service), for the sake of securing newcomers with more flexible terms and poaching high-profile holdouts like the New York Times, it seems that Apple to be a bit more transparent to consumers about what all this new news service is and is not.

        Blizzard      33  shares                                                      Players of Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm noticed something in the latest patch notes: the developers were removing the ability to buy loot boxes with real money. Given the battle that game publishers are fighting with officials across the globe over loot boxes, it’s possible this is an sign of things to come — an experiment Blizzard is running with one of its smaller games that could prevent trouble for its bigger ones, and gauge how an invested community of gamers will respond.  According to the Heroes patch notes, “Loot chests are no longer available for Gem purchase… Rare loot chests are now available for Gold purchase (3000 each).” For those not familiar, Gems are the only form of in-game currency that can be obtained with real-world money. Players get Gold by playing. It’s hard not to see this as an attempt to separate Heroes from the accusations of loot box gambling that have plagued the games industry for a few years now.      Check out the lineup so far for TNW2019  Google, Reddit, and Slack will be there.   Join them    While daily developments on the loot box front have cooled somewhat from the fever pitch at which they burned over the last few years, they’re still a controversial topic in the industry. The FTC is reportedly still in the process of investigating the practice , to see if they constitute a threat to consumers, though the investigation was suspended during the government shut-down. Some European countries have already taken legal steps against them, including Belgium (which has outlawed them) and the Netherlands (which is reportedly forcing some games to modify them, though authorities haven’t disclosed which ones).  The controversy has always been that when you buy loot boxes, you don’t know what you could be buying, and therefore it’s a little closer to gambling than anyone would like — particularly since kids play the games. To be clear, you can still buy specific heroes, gameplay boosts, and other items within the game with Gems. You just can’t use Gems to buy loot chests, meaning it’s technically no longer gambling. It’s not the most thorough solution — that would be to do away with loot chests entirely — but it’s a way of wriggling out of the more problematic aspects of the game feature.  For players of the game, this is neither the biggest nor most serious change to the game in the last few months. Blizzard has been steadily scaling back support for Heroes , up to and including dismantling its official esports league . This relative obscurity makes Heroes the perfect guinea pig for changes that could cause major upset in one of the company’s bigger games. Overwatch , for example, still has purchasable loot boxes, but that’s a game with a much more robust esports scene and an ardent community whose reaction is harder to predict. By starting with Heroes , Blizzard is testing the change in a smaller pond. So far, gamers barely seem to have noticed, and those who do are positive about it.  We’ve contacted Blizzard for more information. The changes in this patch are now live in the game.  TNW Conference 2019 is coming!

It can tell the time, of course, but it can also beam important notifications straight to your wrist, track your fitness stats and pay for your morning coffee. Today's best smartwatch models can perform a ton of tricks, such as enabling you to search the internet with your voice, track your location with GPS or even monitor your heart rate to protect your overall health. Oh, and some of them look absolutely stunning too. If you're thinking that a smartwatch is a pointlessly geeky accessory... think again. The choices we've ranked below are well-made, powerful and can genuinely make you fitter through some smart nudges. What's big in March? The latest big name smartwatch is the Fitbit Versa Lite , which is a cheaper version of a smartwatch included in our list below. Baselworld 2019 also saw some new hybrid watches and new styles of existing watches, although none of them are likely to break into this list. We've tested the vast majority of the top-end wearables you can buy right now from the Apple Watch to Fitbits, Garmin trackers to Tizen-sporting Samsung smartwatches. There's also Wear OS (you may have known that in its previous incarnation called Android Wear) which is Google's own wearable operating system. During our review process, we take into account the design, features, battery life, spec, price and more for each smartwatch, rank it against the competition and enter it into the list you'll find below. Smartwatches come and go from the ranking depending on the rest of the competition at the time, and bear in mind we may see products like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active ,  Fossil Sport and Honor Watch Magic appear in the list after we've tested them properly. It looks like 2019 is set to be a big year in the wearables space too, so expect lots of change in this list if we hear official announcements for products like the Google Pixel Watch and the Apple Watch 5 .

Following on from the Gear S3 series and the Gear Sport in 2017, the Galaxy Watch is much improved. We've tested out the larger 46mm version of the watch and it comes with a phenomenal four day battery life even when you're using it extensively. That's impressive considering a lot of other watches on this list last a day or so from a single charge. The rotating bezel remains a highlight of navigating around the Tizen OS on the watch, and the interface is one of the easiest to pick up that we've seen on a smartwatch. Apps available on the watch are more limited than Wear OS or watchOS - two rival smartwatch operating systems - but it still offers the core basics and Samsung had provided a watch that's good at fitness as well as sporting a great design and lots more functionality too. Read the full Samsung Galaxy Watch review What's next? It's not strictly a sequel to the Samsung Galaxy Watch, but the company has just unveiled its new Galaxy Watch Active . It's a sportier version without the rotatable bezel, plus the price is lower than Samsung's last smartwatch.

Apple Watch 4 The best Apple Watch money can buy OS: watchOS 5 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.78"" OLED | Processor: Apple S4 | Band sizes: Varies based on watch size | Onboard storage: 16GB | Battery: 1 to 2 days | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: Water-resistant to 50m | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, LTE $384  View at Amazon $399 View at Walmart See all prices (327 found) ? 232 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Larger display Lightweight design Battery isn't amazing Still pricey Coming in a close second, the Apple Watch Series 4 is our second favorite smartwatch you can buy right now. This is the first time Apple has updated the design of its smartwatch line, and it looks all the better for it. You get a much bigger screen with the choice of 40mm or 44mm watch sizes, there's a wider display (which is still bright and clear) as well as all the rest of the tech we've come to expect from the Apple Watch. The speaker on this watch is louder than before, the design is still lightweight (yet it feels premium) and you can use all your existing Apple Watch straps with this latest generation too. The most exciting tech is the fact there's an ECG feature within the heart rate tracker. It can test your heart to see if you're at a high risk of atrial fibrillation, which will allow you to seek help earlier if your health is in danger. This tech isn't present at launch, and right now we only know it'll be available in the US. I's not an upgrade relevant to everyone, but for some people this could be some life changing tech. There are still tons of fitness features and the latest watchOS 5 apps onboard so you'll likely love this smartwatch. The Apple Watch 4 is our favorite watch you can use with an iPhone (this won't work with Android devices), but it's just been pipped to the title of best overall smartwatch. Read the full Apple Watch 4 review What's next? The Apple Watch 4 was announced and released in September 2018, and we don't expect to see the Apple Watch 5 until the same month this year.

TicWatch E2 A fully-loaded Wear OS watch you’ve never heard of OS: Wear OS | Compatibility: Android 4.3+, iOS 8+ | Display: 1.39"" 400 x 400 OLED | Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: Around 48h | Charging method: Magnetic connecting pin | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 $159.99  View at Amazon $159.99 View at Amazon Check Walmart See all prices (3 found) ? Affordable price Easily two day battery life No NFC for payments Bland design One of the cheapest devices on this list, the TicWatch E2 is from a relatively small brand called Mobvoi but it has made a big splash with its latest couple of smartwatches. The E2 is waterproof, comes with great battery life and it's all available for an affordable price. You probably won't fall in love with the design of this watch - it's not particularly premium - but we like the look considering how much it costs. For health, the watch comes with built-in GPS, an accurate heart rate sensor and sleep tracking. All of the fitness features you'd expect are here, but make sure you note that it won't be able to do contactless payments as there's no NFC onboard.

Fitbit Versa A smaller and cheaper Fitbit Ionic OS: Fitbit OS | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: TBC, 1000 nits | Processor: Dual-core 1.0GHz | Onboard storage: 2.5GB | Battery duration: 3-4 days | Charging method: Proprietary charger | IP rating: 50M water resistant | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth $199.95  View at Amazon $229.95 View at Dell See all prices (80 found) ? 4 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Lightweight design Relatively low price No GPS Feels a little cheap and childish Fitbit is one of the biggest names in fitness tracking tech, but until late in 2017 the company hadn't gone anywhere near smartwatches. The company has now released two smartwatches, and both feature on this list but first we're starting with our favorite that was announced in March 2018. That favorite from Fitbit is the Versa that is a touch smaller than the other one (that's the Ionic) but it comes with Fitbit Pay for contactless payments, 2.5GB of storage for music and battery life that'll last around three days. It doesn't have GPS for tracking your runs and the design doesn't feel as premium as some of the other watches on this list, but we really like the Fitbit Versa and it's one of the more affordable choices on this list. Read the full Fitbit Versa review What's next? The new Fitbit Versa Lite was announced on March 6. It's a cheaper alternative to the watch we've just spoken about above, and we're hoping to have a review underway soon.

TicWatch Pro The watch with two screens OS: Wear OS | Compatibility: Android 4.3+, iOS 8+ | Display: 1.4"" 400 x 400 OLED paired with LCD screen | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: Up to 48h, 5 extra days in Essential mode | Charging method: Magnetic connecting pin | IP rating: IP68 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC $249.99  View at Amazon Check Walmart See all prices (2 found) ? 494 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Innovative screen tech Premium design Limited app No LTE features One of our favorite Wear OS watches is the TicWatch Pro , which you can use with either an iPhone or with your Android phone. You may not have heard of TicWatch before, but the latest from the company it a top-end watch with a unique dual-screen feature. There are two displays on this watch - one layered on top of the other. On the top is a transparent LCD display that can display the time, your heart rate and more when the battery is low. Below that is a bright and bold full color OLED screen that will give you all of the benefits of Wear OS. That means you can have a normal smartwatch, which we found would last around two days, and then have the time and some other features still available when your battery is running low. Plus the low power mode also lasts for a whole 30 days too. In terms of smartwatch features there's GPS, NFC for Google Pay, Bluetooth for listening to music and the top Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset in here running the watch as well. Then there's the price, which undercuts a lot of the other watches on this list.

Apple Watch 3 2017's best smartwatch is now cheaper OS: watchOS 5 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB / 16GB (Non-LTE and LTE respectively) | Battery duration: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC Low Stock $254.99  View at Walmart Marketplace $299 View at Walmart See all prices (162 found) ? 122 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Brilliant fitness tracking Non-LTE version much better value LTE is an unnecessary expense Battery too short for sleep tracking The Apple Watch 3 (or Apple Watch Series 3, if you're picky) was the best smartwatch but has recently been bumped off the top spot and down a few places since the launch of the Apple Watch 4. The Apple Watch 3 is essentially just the Apple Watch 2 frame with some new innards... but they make a big difference. Plus the price has recently dropped, making this a much more attractive proposition. The LTE connection is the headline event, although that's not really as useful as some might hope - plus it costs a lot more to use, and drains the battery. What we like is the non-LTE version, which is a lot cheaper, and offers all the smarts of the Watch 2 but with a longer battery life and faster speeds when flicking through apps. It's still water-resistant so you can swim with it and you won't have to worry about getting it wet in the rain when you're out for a jog. There's GPS onboard to make running that little bit easier plus it you can now upgrade to watchOS 5 too.

TicWatch S2 Remarkably similar to the E2 OS: Wear OS | Compatibility: Android 4.3+, iOS 8+ | Display: 1.39"" 400 x 400 OLED | Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: Around 48h | Charging method: Magnetic connecting pin | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 $179.99  View at Amazon $179.99 View at Amazon Check Walmart See all prices (3 found) ? 2 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Affordable Waterproof design Lacks NFC No LTE variant Another TicWatch is here in this list, and this one is remarkably similar to the TicWatch E2. In fact, the spec is almost exactly the same but the S in the name of this version stands for 'Sport'. Rather than extra fitness features, the reason for the S2 is to offer you a more durable design that may be applicable to anyone looking for an adventure watch. It's made of military grade materials, which is something the E2 doesn't offer. Everything else is here, including the affordable price point although it is a touch more expensive than the watch listed earlier in this ranking. There's built-in GPS, a waterproof design and the latest Wear OS software to play with. There's no NFC here, so you won't be able to use Google Pay on this watch and there's no LTE option but considering the low price those are unlikely to be things you'll miss much.

Misfit Vapor 2 A revamped watch from the fitness experts Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch display, 360 x 360 AMOLED | Processor: Dual-core 1.0GHz | Band sizes: 20mm straps | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: A day | Charging method: Proprietary | IP rating: N/A | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS $249.99  View at Amazon $249.99 View at Amazon See all prices (2 found) ? Affordable price NFC for Google Pay No LTE option Kind of flimsy The second attempt at a smartwatch from Misfit has gone down even better than the first. This watch is designed to sit somewhere in between a premium, fashionable smartwatch and a must-have for fitness lovers. It doesn't do either of those things perfectly, and instead does both quite well. It's a good looking watch that doesn't cost the same amount as some of the more expensive Wear OS watches you can buy. It is sporting the older Snapdragon 2100 chipset, but it features built-in GPS, NFC for Google Pay and a variety of other features that may make you want it.

Fitbit Ionic The fitness brand's first big smartwatch play OS: Fitbit OS | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: TBC, 1000 nits | Processor: Dual-core 1.0GHz | Band sizes: Large | Onboard storage: 2.5GB | Battery duration: 2-3 days | Charging method: Proprietary charger | IP rating: 50M water resistant | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth $229.98  View at Amazon $269.95 View at Walmart See all prices (36 found) ? 4 Amazon customer reviews ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Bright display Variety of fitness options Slow interface Severe lack of apps The Fitbit Ionic was always going to be a tough move for the brand, trying to enter the world of smartwatches from fitness bands. The effort succeeds in some places: namely fitness, as you might imagine, where you can track all manner of things, from running to weight lifting to swimming. There's also dedicated bodyweight coaching sessions in there, and you can pay for items on the go using Fitbit Pay. When it first launched, the price was super high and it was a bit too expensive to wholeheartedly recommend. The good news is the price seems to have dropped in recent months so you can get it for at least $70/£70 cheaper than the RRP. If you're a Fitbit fan looking to do more than you get on an average band, this is a nice option. Read the full Fitbit Ionic review What's next? Rumors about a new Ionic are few and far between, but we've put together a guide on what we want to be improved if it releases a Fitbit Ionic 2 .

TicWatch C2 Another TicWatch to round off the list Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.3-inch 360 x 360 AMOLED | Processor: Dual-core 1.0GHz | Band sizes: 20mm or 18mm straps | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: A day | Charging method: Proprietary | IP rating: IP68 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS $199.99  View at Amazon Check Walmart See all prices (2 found) ? Low price Google Pay and GPS Limited straps Outdated internals This isn't the greatest TicWatch you can buy - there's already three other devices from the manufacturer Mobvoi on this list - but instead it's an option if you're looking for a more premium device than the TicWatch E or S but don't want to opt for the Pro. The TicWatch C2 comes with a more high-end design than those two cheaper watches, but it doesn't cost as much as the TicWatch Pro. That makes it a solid Wear OS choice if you want a watch that looks good on your wrist with a few fitness features mixed in for good measure. You can't currently buy the watch without a leather band, which is a little bit odd but if you're happy with that or you don't mind buying another third-party strap, this could be a good smartwatch choice for you.

They’re intuitive, of course, and there’s the usual Cupertino fussiness around the details, but the important point came at the end. “They’re designed to keep your personal information private and secure,” he told the audience. As each new product came out — a credit card, a news service, and a premium TV channel service — the executives emphasized how careful they were being about the data involved and how much they prized the user’s privacy.  From the right angle, you can see a broader picture of how Apple thinks about services taking shape. In streaming and digital payments, Apple is competing against a generation of tech companies that are all deeply influenced by Jobs and the iPhone. A good sense of design and software ecosystems are table stakes but not enough to give them an edge against Google and Facebook. Apple’s edge is that, unlike those giants, it doesn’t sell targeted ads, and it doesn’t collect and distribute the massive amounts of personal data associated with that. Given the choice, Apple is guessing you’ll want the digital wallet without the billion-dollar ad business attached. In that way of thinking, online services compete on trust, and Apple is pitching itself as a privacy provider .  Each new service fits into the same privacy pitch  Apple has made this pitch before, although it’s rarely been as pronounced as it was at Monday’s event. As Facebook has weathered scandal after scandal, Tim Cook has positioned Apple as a model of responsible tech, calling for a federal crackdown on data brokers and embracing calls for new data privacy standards . For services like Photos and iMessage, where Google and Facebook offer near-identical competitors, Apple has made a point of keeping data local to the device — a step the competition can’t take for business reasons.  Apple’s event this week focused on a new Apple Pay-integrated credit card, a revamped news app, and streaming services for games and TV, and each one fits into the same privacy pitch. What you spend your money on is incredibly sensitive data, and it’s widely monetized through the same data brokers that Cook pushed to regulate. Apple can plausibly claim to be less interested in monetizing your data than Visa or Bank of America because it’s making all of the money it needs by selling you the device. When the Apple Card’s Goldman Sachs partnership came up, a carefully worded privacy promise appeared onstage: “Goldman Sachs will never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing.” (The Card’s privacy page clarifies: “Of course, Goldman Sachs will use your data to operate Apple Card.”)  The same privacy concerns apply to the articles you read, which are both potentially sensitive and crammed with cross-site trackers to let the sites make money. A subscription service removes all of that, at least in theory, leaving only Apple with the data. Netflix and Amazon don’t target ads, but the new generation of smart TVs increasingly do, giving you one more reason to watch things on your iPad instead.  Like most Apple projects, this is more about the ecosystem than any one service  Like most Apple projects, this is more about the ecosystem than any one service. If you truly believe Apple is better at safeguarding your data, then you wouldn’t stop at just using an Apple Card for payments. You’ll want to use Apple services for all of your sensitive data — and, of course, you’ll need Apple devices to do that. Even if the company doesn’t make extra money on the Apple Card itself, privacy-focused services could pay massive dividends in other parts of the company. Crucially, Apple is still collecting a lot of data. In most cases, it’s just sharing it with fewer companies.  There are reasons to be skeptical. Apple still collects a lot of your data to optimize services and, occasionally, to serve targeted ads , even if it doesn’t do it at the scale of Google and Facebook. The fact that its services are private might also be less convincing against Netflix and HBO, Apple’s main competitors on the streaming TV, both of which sell a fairly straightforward product without any targeted ad shenanigans to fund the product. Perhaps most significantly, Apple’s new reputation as a privacy protector relies on looking beyond iCloud’s history of account hacks, most notably the 2014 hacks that compromised celebrity accounts and flooded nude pictures onto the internet. Even if you trust Apple completely, you’re putting your data in the hands of a single centralized entity that knows who you are, which is inherently riskier than using a patchwork of more federated products.  Still, it’s hard to fault Apple for trying. There’s a serious lack of trust in the tech world right now, and any company that can bridge that gap will reap immense rewards. It’s not easy to compete with Google and Facebook, and this kind of privacy play could be the best way to do it. As Apple dives headlong into the services business , it’s exactly the kind of angle it needs.

Stephen Lam/Getty Images     After years of circling the TV business, Apple is finally ready to make its big splash: On Monday it will unveil its new video strategy, along with some of the  new big-budget TV shows it is funding itself.  One thing Apple won’t do is unveil a serious  competitor to Netflix, Hulu, Disney, or any other entertainment giant trying to sell streaming video subscriptions to consumers.  Instead, Apple’s main focus — at least for now — will be helping other people sell streaming video subscriptions and taking a cut of the transaction. Apple may also sell its own shows, at least as part of a bundle of other services. But for now, Apple’s original shows and movies should be considered very expensive giveaways, not the core product.  That is much less exciting than “Apple Takes on Netflix in the Streaming Wars,” but it is an accurate description. Even worse for people interested in exciting narratives: Apple has already been helping people sell video subscriptions and taking a cut of the transaction for years.  The difference, say people who’ve talked to Apple about its plans, is that instead of selling TV subscription apps surrounded by millions of other apps in its main app store, Apple plans on making a new storefront that’s much more prominent for those who use Apple TV boxes and other Apple hardware. It will also be able to offer its own bundles — for instance, it could offer a package of HBO, Showtime, and Starz at a price that’s lower than you’d pay for each pay TV service on its own.  And, as it already does on its TV app, Apple will be able to show users what’s playing on services they subscribe to and surface stuff they may be interested in.  All of this might very well work. Apple has an installed base of 1.4 billion users, and some of them will buy the things Apple promotes: Look at the success of Apple Music, which launched seven years after Spotify but quickly amassed 50 million subscribers due to a free trial period and prominent real estate on Apple’s devices.  Another reason this could work: Amazon has already been very successful with its own version of the same idea. Facebook is also bullish on selling TV subscriptions and is pushing would-be partners to sign up so it can launch later this spring or summer, according to industry sources. Similarly, Comcast (which is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns this site) is rolling out Flex , a $5-a-month service that gives you a bunch of free content (some of which you can also get other places) and the ability to easily buy HBO, Showtime, etc. Instead of offering exclusive content, Comcast is offering subscribers a Roku-like streaming box.  If you are a fan of the “Apple can’t innovate anymore” theory, some of the above will provide you more ammunition: Apple’s big launch is a revamped version of something it’s already doing, and something its competitors are doing, too. “It’s incremental,” shrugs an executive at a company that’s working with Apple on the new, new video store.  But I’m partial to the theory that Apple won’t make another iPhone because the iPhone was a once-in-a-lifetime product, which happens to be the theory Apple has been implicitly promoting for several years now. As Apple’s iPhone sales have slowed , Apple has been pushing the idea of generating more “service” revenue — selling more software, entertainment, and subscription services to people who already own Apple hardware.  Speaking of that, a brief detour to talk about the other service stuff we expect to see Monday:    Apple will unveil a “Netflix for news” service based on Texture, the magazine app it bought last year. In addition to stories from magazines publishers like Conde Nast and Hearst, which it already offered, it will offer news from the Wall Street Journal and other publishers — but not the New York Times and the Washington Post. Publishers believe Apple will price the plan as a standalone service at $10 a month.   Apple is working with Goldman Sachs on a joint credit card , which will reportedly have special features when paired with iPhones. Goldman CEO David Solomon will be at Apple’s event at its Cupertino, California, HQ on Monday , so expect to hear more about that next week.  Industry observers assume Apple will sell access to multiple services, perhaps including Apple Music and/or some of its cloud storage offers, as part of a bundle.   All of which sounds fine. And potentially very lucrative. And, if you squint hard and hope, a potential new revenue boost for publishers, who could use one.  But that’s not nearly as fun as Apple taking on Netflix. Let’s go back to that one and explain why it’s not so.  Yes, Apple may be spending $2 billion a year on dozens of shows, which feature participation from brand names like Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, and JJ Abrams . And yes, it may even sell a subscription to those shows to people who use the service on other company’s hardware, like Samsung TVs .  But Apple’s partners believe Apple’s primary plan is to use the shows as added value giveaways, either to people who own Apple phones and other devices or to people who buy some of the other services it will roll out Monday.  That makes sense. Because while $2 billion a year is a lot of money, it’s not much compared to the $10 billion a year Netflix says it will spend on programming  this year.  And, crucially, Apple will launch from a standing start: Those new shows will be the only shows Apple has to offer, because it doesn’t have a library of existing stuff, like Hulu and Netflix. And WarnerMedia and Disney will be drawing from their own giant catalog of movies and TV shows when they launch their own subscription services later this year.  Apple could certainly license a lot of other stuff if it wanted to — or just purchase the entertainment companies outright that own that stuff. (In the past, for instance, Apple had briefly discussed buying Time Warner, primarily to get its hands on HBO.) But right now, Apple’s strategy seems to be letting other streamers fight each other while it collects rent from all of them.  Some backstage details:   One under-the-covers change that matters to Apple and its partners: With the new video storefront/service, Apple will host and serve the streams, which means it will have primary access to the viewing data its users generate. Under the previous model, streaming video apps Apple offered essentially redirected users back to the streamers’ own hosting service. Streamers who work with Apple in the new setup will have to be comfortable with Apple owning the primary relationship with their audience.  That wholesale/retail relationship also means Apple, not the streamers, can set the price for the stuff it sells. Apple isn’t likely to sell, say, HBO for less than HBO sells itself on rival platforms like Roku. But it definitely plans to sell bundles of pay TV channels at a discount, just like pay TV operators have always done.   Netflix has already said it won’t be part of Apple’s store . But some other prominent names may be missing on Monday: An industry source says Apple hasn’t tried to get every big subscription service on board, at least for launch.

Early Verdict  A strong phone from Huawei that's well put together, but one that lacks any real headline spec beyond the camera. The four sensor array impresses and the zoom is mind-blowing if used correctly - but is that enough for a real flagship?      For  Strong camera  Mind-bending zoom capabilities      Against  Specs don't wow  Screen colors a little muted           Huawei has moved from being an underdog to being one of the bigger phone brands in the world, thanks to a fusion of heavy marketing and, well, making ever-improving phones. The new Huawei P30 Pro takes a lot of what we saw with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro but improves some elements of the design as well as rebooting the camera somewhat - and is a distinctly more powerful phone than the Huawei P30 in a few ways. We spent an hour playing with the new phone from the Chinese brand, and while some elements felt a little too familiar, some features of the camera absolutely blew us away. Huawei P30 Pro price and release date We had to wait until right until the very end of the launch, but the Huawei P30 Pro price is in: if you're looking for 8GB of RAM, well, you've come to the right place as the P30 Pro only has that spec variant. There are three storage flavors though, and these are: 128GB for €999 (around £850 / $1120 / AU$1500), 256GB for €1099 (around £940 / $1240 / AU$1700) and 512GB for €1249 (around $1050 / $1400 / AU$2000). In terms of the release date for the P30 Pro, you're able to buy it from the date of the launch (March 26) - so if you want it, go grab it. However, it won't be on shop shelves in some territories until a little later - the Huawei P30 Pro UK release date isn't until April 5, for instance. We're still not expecting these phones to be sold in the US any time soon. The best Huawei P30 Pro deals are all listed right here Design and screen The curved sides taper away nicely in the hand. The Huawei P30 Pro comes in four colors: a light blue (called Breathing Crystal... we know), The purple / blue mix of 'Aurora', the orange 'Amber Sunrise' and the more standard... 'Black') The range is pearlescent, and shimmers with different tones rather attractively, apart from black, which is basically so reflective as to be a mirror. We're assuming the name 'Black Mirror' wasn't allowed to be used. We weren't given the exact dimensions of the phone in our briefing, but the 6.47-inch OLED display fits neatly into the front of the phone, with a small teardrop notch for the camera. The notch is already seeming a bit outdated on phones - we were surprised to not see a punch-hole. It's interesting to hear Huawei call said cut-out 'beautiful' when in previous briefings we’ve been told how the punch-hole selfie-cam idea is the future... at least, that's what Huawei’s sister company Honor told us, and they have the same design team. The Aurora and Black colors of the P30 Pro. The overall effect of the screen quality is that, despite it being ‘only’ Full HD, you're getting a very impressive picture. The peak brightness stuns at times, with a bright sunset powering out from a dark scene. However, we're not sure there's any HDR support in the screen here, so that's something we're looking to follow up on soon. If you're expecting vibrant OLED technology here, it's best to hold off clicking that ‘pre-order now’ button until  you've seen the muted, natural colors of the display on the P30 Pro. It's certainly not an issue, but it is something you'll want to check out in person. The Huawei P30 Pro design isn't earth-shattering, although the screen does taper away and curve into the sides of a rather thick aluminum band that runs around the outside of the device. That band houses the USB-C connector (but sadly no headphone jack, unlike the P30 ‘normal’), as well as the single, downwards-firing mono speaker. It feels a bit old-fashioned to not have a stereo speaker setup, but that’s because there’s no conventional speaker for taking calls – the screen itself vibrates, using a technology called magnetic levitation. The output from said speaker is only fine – it's not the best we've ever heard, but for a single option it's better than expected in terms of volume and the clarity of music being pumped out. The camera array sits proud from the rear of the phone, pulling in the four sensors together, which can create a rather lopsided feel when it’s laid on the table; but the volume and power button sit nicely where the thumb falls on the right-hand side of the phone. Camera The quad-camera array. The big feature Huawei spent so long briefing us on is the new P30 Pro camera system, which it claims will make us completely rethink smartphone photography. The main thrust is for the Super Spectrum Sensor, a 40MP effort that can pull in light at a ridiculously  high ISO and has an f/1.6 lens for quality night footage. The SuperSpectrum sensor is the feature Huawei is making the biggest deal of here: it's replaced each of the green pixels in a standard RGB sensor with two yellow pixels, so it reckons the sensor will be able to pull more light and color information as a result, with an enhanced ability to suck in red and green light. Combined with Huawei's strong artificial intelligence (AI) photography smarts, the results should be impressive. This is flanked by a 5x telephoto camera (a feat achieved by turning the light coming in 90 degrees inside the phone to give it more space to reflect the image) as well as a time-of-flight range imaging sensor (for better background blurring) and an ultra-wide mode, using a 20MP sensor. Image 1 of 4 Just your average photo, right? Image 2 of 4 Haha - it was zoomed in. Surprise... Image 3 of 4 WAIT, MORE ZOOM? Image 4 of 4 OK, the mind is officially blown. This is from a phone. The Huawei P30 Pro also has 10x lossless zoom, claims the brand, thanks to some inbuilt AI smarts – and it uses that feature to offer a 50x digital zoom, to do things like take a picture of the moon when it's doing something pretty, or just have a really close up look at a poster across the street from a demo area. Just for instance, not saying we're doing that. So how does the camera work on the Huawei P30 Pro? Pretty well. Indoor and outdoor shots look clean, and snap quickly, but do show that same level of sharpness that Huawei phones seem to deliver - it’s up to you whether that’s a bold feature or not. The background blur on photos looks good too, although the shutter lag was pretty pronounced – in fact, most photos we took saw the Huawei P30 Pro asking us to 'hold still' having snapped the shot so it could sharpen the pictures using its AI mode. Image 1 of 2 The selfie camera is fine, but 32MP doesn't seem to add a huge amount from a smaller sensor Image 2 of 2 The depth sensor took a rather long time to work. The night mode didn't impress massively, but when all you can do in a test area is wrap yourself in a curtain it's hardly the most scientific of tests. However, we did note that the iPhone XS Max created a night image that was similar to the P30 Pro, so we're not expecting the new phone to trouble the Google Pixel 3's dominance in the low-light market. Image 1 of 2 This shot was taken in near darkness and yet enhanced nicely Image 2 of 2 Switching to the f/3.4 zoom lens, you can see the difference in quality The selfie camera is powerful – more powerful than is necessary, some might argue – at 32MP and takes a strong enough picture. There's smile mode to take a snap, but we found that we had to smile really widely to have a chance of the feature working – unless we were just jaded by the press room. However, it's in the zoom department that the Huawei P30 Pro really excels. The 5x telephoto zoom and 10x enhanced enlargement both work incredibly well (though not so much at night), and focusing on a small poster across the road showed that the 50x zoom actually gave strong, sharp photos too. Huawei's AI game is strong at the moment, using internal smarts to improve the quality of photos, and it's generally done the same here with aplomb. In a month or two, when an update lands you'll even be able to record a video with a small window zooming in on the action... we can't see why you'd really want to do that though, so it not being a launch feature isn't the end of the world. Battery The battery life on the Huawei P30 Pro wasn't disclosed by the brand, but it did unveil an increased power pack inside the phone that offers 4200mAh of power. Given we know that Huawei is great at providing battery management features, we're expecting this internal juice box to keep chugging along nicely for at least a single day. However, if the levels are looking a bit low before you're ready to leave work, the 40W fast charging on the Huawei P30 Pro means you can get to 70% power in just 30 minutes, which is pretty incredible. There's also speedy 15W wireless charging, and the capability to charge another phone or pair of wirelessly-powered headphones with some reverse wireless power delivery. Truly, we're living in the future. What's it like to use? The Huawei P30 Pro uses EMUI 9.1 a Kirin 980 chipset and an untold amount of RAM – no, literally, they've not told us what it is. We're assuming around 8GB, but like the internal storage there's no notion of what's on offer – although we're expecting storage to start at 128GB for a brand like Huawei. The speed of browsing around the Huawei P30 is much as you’d expect from a modern smartphone. There's a definite fluidity under the finger, and the lightning-fast reactions of the connectivity on our test impressed as we zipped through TechRadar. EMUI 9.1, the latest version of Huawei’s overlay for Android, is less onerous than it used to be in days gone by, with the Google integration for Western versions of this phone on the left screen. There are also fewer messages popping up everywhere when you’re navigating around, and combined with the fast innards and clear screen, the Huawei P30 Pro is adept at whisking you through everyday life tasks. There are still confusing and slightly annoying bugs in the system, for example with the AI video editor, which is supposed to be able to edit clips for you with no input – we could not find that anywhere in the camera screen. It’s also not as fluid as the iPhone XS or the Samsung Galaxy S10, with some elements of EMUI still feeling a little too overly complex and offering too many choices and tweaks to make. But compare it to a phone from Huawei that’s just five years old and you’ll see a massive change in the way the interface works. Early verdict The Huawei P30 Pro is one of the strongest phones the brand has ever produced, but the upgrades feel a little more incremental this year. The new colors shine nicely, the screen's teardrop notch isn’t too intrusive, and while the camera system does at least offer something different, it's still in a minor way. The speed under the finger is a nice touch, but we're looking forward to testing the real differences between the Huawei P30 Pro and last year's Mate 20 Pro, or the Huawei P20 Pro, to see how much really has changed.

Peloton is designed for web-scale companies like Uber with millions of containers and tens of thousands of nodes. Peloton features advanced resource management capabilities such as elastic resource sharing, hierarchical max-min fairness, resource overcommits, and workload preemption. As a cloud-agnostic system, Peloton can be run in on-premise data centers or in the cloud.  At Uber, Peloton is a critical piece of infrastructure powering our compute clusters. It is currently running many kinds of batch workloads in production, and we are planning to migrate stateless services workloads to it as well.  Today, Uber is excited to announce that we are open sourcing Peloton. By allowing others in the cluster management community to leverage unified schedulers and workload co-location, Peloton will open the door for more efficient resource utilization and management across the community. Moreover, open sourcing Peloton will enable greater industry collaboration and open up the software to feedback and contributions from industry engineers, independent developers, and academics across the world.  Benefits of using Peloton  To our knowledge, there is no other open source scheduler which combines all types of workloads for web-scale companies like Uber. Prior to Peloton, each workload at Uber had its own cluster, resulting in many inefficiencies. With Peloton, we can colocate mixed workloads in shared clusters for better resource utilization.  As shown by the Google Borg paper , co-locating diverse workloads on shared clusters is key to improving cluster utilization and reducing overall cluster cost . Below, we outline some examples of how co-locating mixed workloads will drive utilization in our compute clusters, as well as helps us more accurately plan cluster provisioning:   Resource overcommitment and job preemption are key to improving cluster resource utilization. However, it is very expensive to preempt online jobs, such as stateless or stateful services that are often latency sensitive. Hence, preventing preemption of these latency-sensitive jobs requires us to co-locate batch jobs that are low-priority and preemptible on the same cluster, enabling us to better utilize overcommitted resources.  As Uber services move towards an active-active architecture , we will have capacity reserved for disaster recovery (DR) in each data center. That DR capacity can be used for batch jobs until data center failover occurs. Also, sharing clusters with mixed workloads means we no longer need to buy extra DR capacity for online and batch workloads separately.  Uber’s online workloads spike during big events like Halloween or New Year’s Eve . We need to plan capacity for these high-traffic events well in advance, requiring us to buy hardware separately for online and batch jobs. During the rest of the year, this extra hardware is underutilized, leading to extra, and unnecessary, technical costs. By co-locating both workloads on the same cluster, we can lend capacity from batch workloads to online workloads for those spikes without buying extra hardware.  Different workloads have resource profiles that are often complementary to each other. For example, stateful services or batch jobs might be disk IO intensive but stateless services often use little disk IO. Given these profiles, it makes more sense to co-locate stateful services with batch jobs on the same cluster.   Realizing that these scenarios would enable us to achieve greater operational efficiency, improve capacity planning, and optimize resource sharing, it was evident that we needed to co-locate different workloads together on one single, shared compute platform. A unified resource scheduler will enable us to manage all kinds of workloads to use our resources as efficiently as possible both in private data centers and the cloud.  Peloton will support Uber’s workloads with a single, shared platform, balancing resource usage by elastically sharing resources, and helping teams better plan for future capacity needs. Learn more about these benefits by reading our recent article on Peloton.

Frederic Lardinois,technology,"                        Google makes emails more dynamic with AMP for Email     Frederic Lardinois   @fredericl  / 11 hours         Google today officially launched  AMP for Email , its effort to turn emails from static documents into dynamic, web page-like experiences. AMP for Email is coming to Gmail, but other major email providers like Yahoo Mail (which shares its parent company with TechCrunch), Outlook and Mail.ru will also support AMP emails.  It’s been more than a year since Google first announced this initiative. Even by Google standards, that’s a long incubation phase, though there’s also plenty of backend work necessary to make this feature work.  The promise of AMP for Email is that it’ll turn basic messages into a surface for actually getting things done. “Over the past decade, our web experiences have changed enormously—evolving from static flat content to interactive apps—yet email has largely stayed the same with static messages that eventually go out of date or are merely a springboard to accomplishing a more complex task,” Gmail product manager Aakash Sahney writes. “If you want to take action, you usually have to click on a link, open a new tab, and visit another website.”   With AMP for Email, those messages become interactive. That means you’ll be able to RSVP to an event right from the message, fill out a questionnaire, browse through a store’s inventory or respond to a comment — all without leaving your web-based email client.  Some of the companies that already support this new format are Booking.com, Despegar, Doodle, Ecwid, Freshworks, Nexxt, OYO Rooms, Pinterest, and redBus. If you regularly get emails from these companies, then chances are you’ll receive an interactive email from them in the coming weeks.  For developers, supporting this format should be fairly easy, especially if they have prior experience with building AMP pages. The format supports many popular AMP markup features, including carousels, forms and lists. It’s also worth noting that these messages still include standard HTML markup as a fallback for email clients that support AMP.  Since its first announcement, Google has also brought on a number of partners that will support AMP for Email on their platforms. These include email delivery and analytics platform SparkPost, the email design and marketing tool Litmus, Twilio Sendgrid and Amazon’s SES and Pinpoint email and marketing tools.   AMP for email is a terrible idea   No everybody is going to like this (including our own Devin Coldewey ). AMP itself, after all, remains somewhat controversial given that it creates a new markup and infrastructure that wouldn’t be necessary if people created faster and simpler web sites to begin with. Bringing it to email, which for all its shortcomings remains one of the few formats that reliably work across all vendors and clients, won’t be everybody’s cup of tea either. Marketers, however, are bound to love it and I doubt most users are going to care about the politics here if it allows them to get their work done faster.

Kirsten Korosec,technology,"                        Linear Labs’ next-gen electric motor attracts $4.5 million in funding     Kirsten Korosec  10 hours         Linear Labs, a startup developing an electric motor for cars, scooters, robots, wind turbines and even HVAC systems, has raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by Science Inc. and Kindred Ventures.  Investors Chris and Crystal Sacca, Ryan Graves of Saltwater Ventures, Dynamic Signal CEO Russ Fradin, Masergy executive chairman and former-CEO Chris MacFarland, as well as Ustream co-founder Gyula Feher also participated in the round.  The four-year-old company was founded by Brad and Fred Hunstable, who say they have invented a lighter, more flexible electric motor. The pair came up with the motor they’ve dubbed the Hunstable Electric Turbine (HET) while working to design a device that could pump clean water and provide power for small communities in underdeveloped regions of the world.  Linear Labs currently has 50 filed patents, 21 of which are issued, with 29 patents pending.  The founders come with a background in entrepreneurship and electrical engineering. Brad Hunstable is former CEO and founder of Ustream, the live-video-streaming service that sold to IBM in 2016 for $150 million. Fred Hunstable, who comes with a background in electrical engineering and nuclear power, led Ebasco and Walker Engineering’s efforts in designing, upgrading and completing electrical infrastructure, environmental and enterprise projects as well as safety and commercial-grade evaluation programs.  The HET uses multiple rotors that can adapt to varying conditions, according to the company. It also produces twice as much torque density and three times the power density than permanent magnet motors. Linear Labs says its motor produces two times the output per given motor size, and minimum 10 percent more range.  The HET design makes it ideally suited for mobility applications such as electric vehicles because it produces high levels of torque without the need for a gearbox. This helps cut production cuts, the company contends.  “The holy grail in electric motors has always been high torque and no gearbox, and the HET achieves both in a smaller, lighter and more efficient package that is more powerful than traditional motors,” Linear Labs CTO Fred Hunstable said in a statement.  The upshot could be electric vehicles with better range and more powerful electric scooters.  The commercialization of the electric motor will result in substantial leaps in terms of energy savings, reliability enhancement, and low-cost manufacturing, according to Babak Fahimi, founding director of the Renewable Energy and Vehicular Technology (REVT) Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas.  The company plans to use the seed funding to market its invention to customers. It’s also hiring talent and recently added new people to its leadership team, including John Curry as their president and Jon Hurry as vice president. Curry comes from KLA-Tencor and NanoPhotonics. Hurry has held positions at Tesla and Faraday Future.

AMP for Gmail is designed to make emails feel more like an interactive webpage without punting users to a browser. Users can browse image carousels, RSVP to an event, or fill out a form without leaving their inbox. Google calls these “dynamic emails.”  Support will arrive first on the web, but Google says it plans to offer it on mobile as well. However, just like AMP instant articles, you’ll only experience dynamic emails if the company that sent you the email supports the format. Currently, AMP for Gmail’s list of partners is small; Google is citing Booking.com, Despegar, Doodle, Ecwid , Freshworks, Nexxt, OYO Rooms , Pinterest, and redBus as companies that will offer dynamic emails in the next few weeks. It did note that several third-party email products , including SparkPost, Litmus, Twilio Sendgrid, and Amazon SES and Pinpoint, have signed on to add AMP support, so if you’re a marketer and you already use these tools to send emails, you should be able to create dynamic emails soon.          AMP for Gmail has rolled out to G Suite customers, but you won’t necessarily have to use Gmail to see dynamic emails. Third-party providers like Outlook, Yahoo Mail, and Mail.ru will support the feature, but to enable it, an admin will need to opt into the beta.  Today’s news comes as Google prepares to kill off Inbox for good , with the app on its last week before support is permanently shut down. Initial responses to AMP for Gmail seem mixed so far: while some prefer fewer tabs when opening emails with calls to action, others say the new format is too complex and can potentially create privacy headaches, such as additional ways for advertisers to track how you’re interacting with your emails or more elaborate phishing scams.

Verdict                 Our Verdict  The new iPad Air (2019) has serious horsepower hidden behind its laminated screen and uses Apple’s excellent Smart Keyboard for proper 2-in-1 for productivity. Its traditional design and first-gen Apple Pencil compatibility make it look dated, but it doubles the performance of the entry-level iPad 9.7. The ‘Air’ revival is a potential Back to School winner this year.      For  Brilliant-looking laminated screen  Cheapest Smart Keyboard iPad  Fast charges via Lightning-to-USB-C    Against  Uses the 1st Gen Apple Pencil  Traditional design doesn't wow  Two speakers instead of four         Please welcome back the iPad Air, now the awkward, destined-to-be-underrated middle child of Apple’s tablet lineup. It took us a few days of testing to realize why it’s still important in 2019. Basically, what we have here is the Jan Brady of iPads. No, it’s not as cute as the new baby, the 7.9-inch iPad mini (2019) , and its traditional looks make it a wallflower compared to the head-turning redesigned iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9 (aka Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!). Over time, we found it’s the iPad for people who want a little more than what the entry-level iPad 9.7 offers. It has a superior 10.5-inch display with thinner bezels, a faster chipset that matches the power in the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max , and a higher-resolution front-facing camera. You also have new options for an Air: it has larger internal storage configurations, compatibility with the excellent Apple Smart Keyboard cover, and performance numbers double those of the iPad 9.7. It’s a wholly better 2-in-1 productivity tool. That’ll make it a winner for some Back to School tablet shoppers in a few months. We’re still left with wanting more in some areas. iOS 12 remains fairly limiting for Apple’s post-PC ‘computer’ pitch, a problem that exists even if you pay for the top-shelf iPad Pro 12.9. The software supports multitasking, sure, but too often we found a MacBook better for our handling moderately complex workflows. It also only works with the first-generation Apple Pencil, not the magnetic second-gen Pencil, and that optional Smart Keyboard doesn’t light up like a MacBook keyboard. That makes it hard to type in the dark. We had some of these same complaints when we reviewed the iPad Pro 9.7. More than anything, the iPad Air (2019) is a repackaged version of the iPad Pro (2017) that Apple has stopped selling. Only it has a serious internal specs bump and addresses one of our main reservations of the otherwise likable Pro from two years ago: it has a palatable price. Jan Brady, notable middle child of the Brady Bunch, often complained about being ‘invisible’. If this new iPad Air could talk, it might have the same gripe, but it’s the cheapest iPad with real power and 2-in-1 functionality. Meaning, come Back to School season, it may have the last laugh. Price and release date The iPad Air (2019) release date is Monday March 25, when the first pre-orders will ship. This follows a subdued announcement via an Apple press release on Monday, March 18. Its price is the complicated selling point that Apple doesn’t hype up enough other than to say ‘Power isn’t just for the pros.’ It costs $499 (£479, AU$779) for this new iPad Air, which makes it cheaper than the relatively similar iPad Pro 10.5 (2017) launch price of $649 (£619, AU$979). Its price is extremely convincing, but we’ve seen the iPad Pro 10.5 price drop over the last two years, so while Apple doesn’t sell it anymore, retailers now have it down to iPad Air (2019) levels. Is there any difference between the two? Kind of. The Air has better internal specs and has eSIM support, but only two speakers compared to the old Pro’s four. The real competition is the iPad 9.7 (2018) – still on sale everywhere. It costs $329 (£319, AU$469), and we saw it drop to $229 during last year’s Black Friday. It was such a good deal, I bought two for my parents, though I find it to be more of a read, not write-focused tablet. The same applies to the new pint-sized iPad mini (2019), starting at $399 (£399, AU$599). The iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, on the other end of the spectrum, start at $799 (£779, AU$1,129) for the 11-inch size. They’re the only Air alternative with reliable 2-in-1 productivity chops. The iPad Air (2019) ends up being your cheapest answer to Apple Smart Keyboard cover support. Display 10.5-inch display with thinner bezels is a nice upgrade over 9.7-inch iPads Laminated screen makes a difference when drawing with the Apple Pencil This is the first iPad Air with a 10.5-inch Retina display and thinner bezels, and we found it to be a big upgrade over all of Apple’s 9.7-inch non-Pro tablets we’ve used in the past. This is mostly down to the fully laminated screen and use of the wide color (P3) palette. Its laminated display means there’s almost no gap between the thinner glass on top and LCD panel underneath. The screen is pressed right up against the glass and really lets the colors pop. It’s hard to unsee the difference next to a cheaper iPad, and it’s a big deal when drawing directly on the screen with the Apple Pencil. We noticed more yellow from this iPad Air screen, and that’s because it uses Apple’s True Tone display technology to better adapt to our environment. Without this setting enabled, the screen looked very blue compared to TechRadar’s office lighting, for example. Outside, we appreciated the screen’s anti-reflective coating that’s exclusive to this new Air and all Pro models. The new iPad Air’s thinner bezels, laminated screen, wider color palette, True Tone display and anti-reflective coating may be enough to convince people to pick up this iPad over the iPad 9.7, which has none of these features. Design Dated design, but you get relics: Touch ID and a headphone jack It's the thinnest non-Pro iPad sold today Colors: silver, gold and Space Gray “This is the new iPad Air,” I exclaimed to my coworkers this week. Their reaction? “Really? It doesn’t look any different.” I walked away in shame (but agreeing). Don’t go into this purchase expecting big changes from this traditional-looking iPad. It won’t wow anyone like the all-screen iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9. But it does have fan-favorite features you won’t find on the new Pros: a 3.5mm headphone jack, and the equally-reliable Touch ID button. And the size, while subtly different from 9.7-inch iPads, allows for the fully-sized 10.5-inch Apple Smart Keyboard to be attached (the same one used by the iPad Pro 10.5). It’s Apple’s thinnest non-Pro iPad at 6.1mm (the Pro is 5.9mm and the iPad 9.7 is 7.5mm), and also weighs just 1lb (456g). Its ‘Air’ moniker actually means something – only iPad mini (2019) is lighter at 0.66lbs (300.5g) among iPads currently on sale. The bottom of this iPad frame sticks with the traditional lightning port (newer Pros use USB-C). That’s an okay design choice for people with tons of lightning cables already, but newer MacBook owners may be ready for the USB-C future. We feel like the bigger omission is lack of the quad speakers that are found on the iPad Pro 10.5 (2017). There are just two speakers here at the bottom of the tablet. New iPad Air colors consist of silver, gold and Space Gray – the latter has a black front, while the others are white. Our review unit is gold, but like the 9.7-inch iPad, it looks a bit like Rose Gold or copper. Oddly enough, Rose Gold isn’t an option on this new iPad. In fact, Rose Gold isn’t an option on any iPad that Apple currently sells.    1   2    3    4    5    Current page:  Introduction, design and display    Next Page  Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil            Tech deals, prizes and latest news     Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

A Redditor unearthed the issue, noting how the malicious advert was disguised to resemble a real Electrum advertisement.     “It even tells you to go the correct link (electrum.org) in the video but when you click on the advertisement it immediately starts downloading the malicious exe file,” the Redditor said.  Image via u/mrsxeplatypus on Reddit The malicious advert would redirect unsuspecting users to elecktrum.org. The real address it should have directed users to is electrum.org.  The scam uses a popular scamming method known as typosquatting , whereby a company’s or product’s original domain name is slightly altered to take users to an illicit website.  In the Reddit post , the user said there was no obvious way to alert Google about the advert.  Hard Fork reached out to Google to verify the advert’s existence.   A representative for the company said: “Our teams have taken appropriate action against the ad you reported.”  This is not the first time Electrum, which uses electrum.org as it’s primary website address, has been taken advantage of by scammers.  In April last year , a scammer purchased a similar-sounding domain name and used it to mimic the company’s services. Eventually, Electrum took to Twitter to confirm it did not own electrum.com and explain it was likely a ‘bitcoin stealing malware.’  Then, little over a month later, the impostor (Electrum Pro) shut down its website in what looked like an exit scam, but blamed Electrum – the real company – for ruining their reputation.  Ultimately, scammers are going to scam, it’s what they do. But it’s up to you (and I!) to remain vigilant online.       Did you know?

Timothy B. Lee - Mar 26, 2019 2:00 pm UTC         An EU flag at the European Parliament. European Parliament / Flickr     reader comments  211  with 109 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Update: The European Parliament approved the new European copyright directive on Tuesday by a vote of 348 to 274. Our original story on the legislation follows.   On Tuesday, the European Parliament will vote on an overhaul of the EU's copyright system. The body will vote on a compromise announced last month that has received the backing of key European governments. An earlier version of the proposal was approved by the European Parliament last September.  The legislation is controversial, with two provisions receiving the bulk of the criticism. Article 11 aims to help news organizations collect more licensing fees from news aggregators like Facebook and Google News. Article 13 aims to help copyright holders to collect licensing fees from user-generated content platforms like YouTube and Facebook.  Further Reading European governments approve controversial new copyright law  Both provisions are maddeningly vague—laying out broad goals without providing much detail about how those goals can be achieved. This is partly because the EU's lawmaking system occurs in two stages. First, EU-wide institutions pass a broad directive indicating how the law should be changed. Then each of the EU's member nations translates the directive into specific laws. This process leaves EU-wide legislators significant latitude to declare general policy goals and leave the details to individual countries.  Still, if the legislation's goals are incoherent or contradictory, then something is going to have to give. And critics warn that the package could wind up damaging the Internet's openness by forcing the adoption of upload filters and new limits on linking to news stories.  Article 13: “They may end up opting for filters”  User-generated content platforms face a basic tradeoff: stronger enforcement of copyright inevitably means some curtailment of legitimate users' freedom. Over the years, Ars has covered  many  cases of YouTube's copyright filters accidentally blocking public domain content or curtailing fair-use rights . At the same time, copyright holders are understandably frustrated that they have to spend so much time policing online sites for infringing copies of their content.  How does Article 13 deal with this dilemma? It basically just declares that the bad outcomes feared by critics shouldn't happen and leaves it up to member countries and technology companies to figure out how to reconcile these competing goals.  ""Cooperation between online content service providers and rightholders shall not result in the prevention of the availability of works or other subject matter uploaded by users which do not infringe copyright and related rights,"" a recent draft of the legislation states, rather optimistically.  Critics of Article 13 have argued that the legislation would force technology companies to adopt upload filers and potentially run roughshod over fair use and other user freedoms. Supporters of the legislation have countered that the legislation doesn't explicitly require anyone to adopt filtering technology.  ""There is no requirement for upload filters,"" states a Q&A drafted by the legislation's supporters . ""However, if large platforms do not come up with any innovative solutions, they may end up opting for filters.""  ""The criticism that these sometimes filter out legitimate content may at times be valid,"" the document concedes. ""But it should be directed toward the platforms designing and implementing them, not to the legislator who is setting out a goal to be achieved.""  Article 11: “Link tax”  Some news organizations have been frustrated to see Google and Facebook raking in billions of dollars of ad revenue while the Internet erodes the economic foundation of traditional news organizations. The organizations believe that Google and Facebook have profited from aggregating their work, and they want the technology giants to share some of those profits with the news industry.  But Google and Facebook are simply summarizing and linking to content available elsewhere on the Web—activities that are squarely within the law in both the United States and Europe. Lots of other websites and Internet users do these things on a regular basis. So if the law tries to force Google and Facebook to pay news sites for the right to link to or summarize their articles, that could undermine everyone else's right to do the same thing.  For this reason, critics of Article 11 have dubbed it a ""link tax."" They warn that it would lead to a future in which you couldn't link to a news article without paying for the privilege of doing so.  To allay those fears, the authors of Article 11 have added language stating that the news organizations' new rights ""shall not apply to acts of hyperlinking"" and also ""shall not apply in respect of uses of individual words or very short extracts of a press publication.""  So then what does it apply to? I asked Danny O'Brien, a critic of the law at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, about this last September.  ""What they're trying to do is prevent automatic scraping,"" he said. Google News scrapes news sites and then provides users with a Google-generated front page featuring titles and links to articles on various news sites. The goal of the legislation, O'Brien suggested, is to prevent Google from using the title of an article in Google News links. The hope is that this will convince Google to start paying European news organizations for the right to link to their news stories.  “The principle behind it is incoherent”  The legislation doesn't accomplish this goal by directly regulating scraping of news sites—and neither does it do so by explicitly banning the use of headlines in hyperlinks. Instead, the legislation gives news organizations a broad, vague right to ""the online use of their press publications by information society service providers"" (aka technology companies like Google and Facebook).  So the practical implications of Article 11 are a real head-scratcher. European nations could require technology companies to get the permission of a news organization before linking to one of its articles. Officially, this would only apply to tech companies themselves. But it's unclear what would happen if a user of a technology platform tried to post a link to a news article?  Alternatively, member countries could give news organizations such a narrow right that it would have little practical impact—Facebook and Google might be able to comply by slightly altering how they format links to news articles. Or maybe different countries will implement Article 11 in different ways, creating a hodgepodge of rules for linking to news articles in different European countries.  ""I'm sorry if I sound incoherent,"" O'Brien said after trying to explain Article 11 to me. ""It's because the principle behind it is incoherent.""    Promoted Comments       Onigato  Smack-Fu Master, in training     jump to post    We already know how Google News is going to react if Article 11 gets passed, we saw it in Spain when their own ""News links ain't allowed no more"" law was enacted. Google News closed their Spanish branches, and Spanish news organizations lost a huge amount of traffic, literally overnight. Repeat this over the entire EU, and watch as the news orgs scream bloody murder.       9 posts | registered 2/1/2019         jack lecou  Ars Centurion     jump to post     Sarty wrote: show nested quotes Both provisions are maddeningly vague—laying out broad goals without providing much detail about how those goals can be achieved.

Then each of the EU's member nations translates the directive into specific laws. I just don't understand how this ever seemed like a good idea. How does it make a lick of sense to hold a vote on a binding directive without defining the binding process by which it shall be achieved? On any topic, ever? It feels like something you'd read about ancient Athens doing, back before humanity had a working understanding of how laws and government and voting probably ought to function. I don't know that's the whole directive/implementation approach is *inherently* wrongheaded. In conception, I think the idea is that it works similar to something like an RFC or standards body process. You wouldn't want the W3C (or even WHATWG) to actually mandate the particular code for a browser to use for a markup feature, for example. In fact, what you want in a standard is usually as few specifics as possible. The bare minimum to make sure that interop works, and no more. Everything else is rightly left up to the implementers, who might come up with very different approaches, working with very different code bases, very different module boundaries, in different programming languages, etc. And in general, I think that works for the EU ok too. For example, consider something like the ""price indication directive"", which just says that standardized per-unit prices should be clearly posted for consumers. The directive itself in that case can be admirably short, just laying out the justification and goals, and the basic, sensible requirements corollary to those. It makes sense to leave all the specifics beyond that up to individual member states: Bulgaria and Belgium are, after all, probably going tol have different agencies or ministries under which that type of regulation is enforced, other existing regulations about the posting of prices that the new directive implementation would be incorporated alongside, etc.  And in the end, there might end up being slight differences from country to country, but even an international chain or website shouldn't have too much trouble complying everywhere it operates. The basic information is the same everywhere, and the intent of the directive is clear enough that a good faith effort is easy to establish. But that's because the goals and mechanisms of that directive are more or less coherent, consistent, and straightforward. The problem with Articles 11 and 13 isn't so much that the directive process itself is broken, it's that the goals and mechanisms behind these specific pieces are all just mutually contradictory and ill-conceived. The whole thing amounts to telling member states to ""implement a circle such that the ratio of the circumference to the radius is equal three, but don't break any of the laws of mathematics to do so, and make sure the penalties are really high for companies that don't make such circles if they're above a certain size, etc."".       393 posts | registered 1/12/2012                    reader comments  211  with 109 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Timothy B.

          in Personal Computing          Comments      88  Shares             Share              Tweet              Share              Save                         Apple                         Yesterday, Apple unveiled Apple News+ , an all-you-can-eat subscription service that offers access to over 300 different magazines and periodicals, including newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times, for $9.99 a month. I already subscribe to a couple of other Apple services like iCloud and Apple Music that are a little bit underwhelming, so I'll admit I'm a bit wary of getting another one. But for a magazine lover like myself, News+ sounded incredibly intriguing.            I had liked iOS's Newsstand before that went away, so I was interested to see if Apple News+ would offer a better experience. Importantly, I wondered if subscribing to News+ would lead me to cancelling my existing magazine subscriptions. After trying it out for a few hours, my answer is... not really. Yet, I'll likely subscribe to News+ all the same. As mentioned in Apple's presentation, News+ is (unsurprisingly) an extension of the existing News app, and not an app of its own. It also requires iOS 12.2, so be sure to upgrade if you want to try it out. News+ is available on the MacOS News app as well, as long as you update to 10.14.4. When you launch the News app on iOS, you'll see the free news portion in the main ""Today"" home screen, along with a new ""News+"" option in the bottom row. On the MacOS app, the ""News+"" option sits underneath the ""Today"" on the left sidebar. Select that, and you'll see some information about what News+ offers. You can then sign up for the service right on the spot. The first month is free, but Apple will start charging you $9.99 a month once the free trial is over. Once you have that squared away, you'll see the News+ homescreen, which is comprised of a selection of your favorite magazines at the top (this section will be empty if you are new to News+), followed by several sections -- First Look and featured stories are human-curated, while stories from categories like ""Health"" and ""Travel"" are based more on your personal preference (it defaults to a curated list on your first time, but you can customize it by ""following"" different topics in the app). Along the top are navigation buttons for browsing the magazine catalog, either in its entirety or via specific genres like Business & Finance or Entertainment. I have to admit, I was impressed with this semi-curated experience. What really sells it for me is that I had instant access to all of the magazine articles on the home screen with just a tap. I could immediately select and read full stories from sources as varied as Rolling Stone , National Geographic , Vanity Fair and the Wall Street Journal without having to endure long loading times, which is sometimes the case with magazine-specific apps. In a way, by collecting all of these stories on the News+ homepage, Apple had created a Franken-zine of sorts of all my different interests. I can see how this could be attractive for casual magazine readers who prefer a buffet-style approach to media consumption. If you do want full access to certain magazines, News+ offers that too. Tap a particular magazine title, for example, and you'll see the most recent cover along with a table of contents. If you tap the magazine title again at the top, you'll be brought to a general overview page where you can access a whole year's worth of back issues as well (Which is good if you happen to miss a particular issue). Also on this page are the publication's latest headlines, which includes stories that are online-only and not available in the print version (at least, not yet). Some publications also offer links to online video, which, again, is obviously not available in print. This is all well and good, but what is the experience of actually reading these magazine stories, especially on my tiny little iPhone? I'll have to admit this is where I was the most skeptical. In Newsstand, for example, it often felt as if some magazines were just PDF scans of the print version, which is just hell to read on a small device. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that this was not necessarily the case with News+. Though Wired , Vanity Fair and the New Yorker had their own distinctive fonts and styles, each story was given the full-screen treatment, and looked like they were designed to fit on the iPhone's display. News+ also lets you increase the font size, just in case the text is too small for you. The same look and feel carries over to the MacOS side too. There are a few caveats though. For one thing, you'll still get ads. Yes, Apple made a big deal that there's no ad tracking in News+, but that doesn't mean the magazines won't have ads. Of course, you can easily bypass them by going straight to a story from the table of contents, but not so much if you were to flip through a magazine's pages ( Dwell , for example, had me flip through 10 pages of ads before I got to the editor's letter). Plus, there are certain magazine layouts that just aren't suited to the single-story treatment. Domino , for example, has catalog-style pages with various furniture and accessory recommendations that is heavy on images. On the iPhone, they look very much like PDF scans that I have to zoom in and out of to read properly. This is more the responsibility of the publication and not the News+ app, but it does put a damper on the experience. Even on the MacOS app, I found the experience to be pretty clunky and less than satisfactory. Perhaps there are simply some magazine formats that work better in print than in digital. There also appears to be some confusion over whether a News+ subscription offers you full access to certain publications. Apparently the Wall Street Journal sent a memo stating the News+ app would only contain a curated collection of its stories. It turns out, however, that this is wrong: a News+ subscription does provide full access to the Wall Street Journal , but general news interest stories are floated to the top more than others. If you want stories on other topics, you'll have to search for them (you can find this feature in the Following tab of the app), which might be a pain for some. The subscription also only allows for three days worth of archives. What's more, it seems that an Apple News+ subscription stands on its own. Just because you can read the New Yorker on Apple News+, for example, doesn't mean you now have unlimited access to New Yorker articles on the web. It appears that, at least for now, if you want full digital access to a certain publication, you'll still need to subscribe to it separately. Not to mention, a lot of periodicals actually offer a combined print and digital rate for the same price. Wired for example is $5 a year for both the print and digital packages (that works out to just under $0.42 a month). If you still want the option for print magazines, this is certainly a more attractive deal. Plus, magazine prices vary wildly, and what's a good deal for one person, may not be for another. If the only magazine you care about is Wired , for example, then an Apple News+ subscription won't make much sense. On the other hand, if you don't want to spend the $40 a month for a WSJ subscription, then the $10 a month for News+ is a big saving. It's also worth mentioning Kindle Unlimited, which many have posited might prove to be a potential rival to News+. For $10 a month, Kindle Unlimited subscribers get access to a rotating selection of over a million books and audiobooks, as well as ""top magazine issues."" The problem with Kindle Unlimited, however, is that it's not a real magazine subscription, since the magazine selection changes every month. The issues also take a long time to download, and the layout appears to mostly be PDF scans, which isn't ideal. Readly, another $10 a month magazine subscription app, has a similar problem with PDF scan layouts that are hard to read on a small screen. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the News+ app experience. I liked that most of the stories I read seem tailor-made for the smaller iPhone screen, and that the News+ app offered me access to online-only stories and formats. What I especially liked was the curated home screen that provides access to a whole array of different magazine stories in one fell swoop. Plus, it offers some of my favorite periodicals in their full form, while letting me sample from others without additional cost. All of that is reason enough for me to keep my $10 a month News+ subscription going. Yet, it's still not quite enough for me to give up my existing subscriptions. For one thing, I have a subscription to the New York Times , which isn't available on News+ at all. I also want to be able to read Wired and New Yorker stories on the web, so I can access them regardless of what computer I'm using. Additionally, I appreciate that these two magazines offer a companion print subscription for the same price. I like the option of kicking back and casually leafing through them on the weekends, when I want a break from the constant barrage of technology. There's just something about flipping through a large, glossy magazine that can't quite be replicated on a backlit screen. Still, I'm not completely tied to physical media, and am willing to give it up for the right price and service. News+ could very well allow for web access in the future, and maybe it'll add the New York Times or the Washington Post too. If so, that could be enough to persuade me to cancel my other subscriptions. Until then, however, I guess I'll cough up for yet another Apple service.

It’s a subscription service that gets users access to a large library of games for a monthly fee, playable across iOS, Mac, and Apple TV. As the App Store and other mobile markets have become dominated by free-to-play games, often at the expense of so-called “premium” titles, this presents a potential solution. “Paid games are often critically acclaimed and beloved by the people who play them, but competing with free is hard, so even the best of these games have only reached a smaller audience,” Apple said when announcing its new service.  There’s still much we don’t know about Apple Arcade, including how much it will cost and, perhaps more crucially, how Apple will be splitting revenue with developers. (I spoke to nearly a dozen mobile game developers and publishers after yesterday’s announcement, and no one was able to discuss specifics at this time.) We do know that Apple will be helping fund the development of these games in some way, and it’s been able to lure big names like Final Fantasy mastermind Hironobu Sakaguchi and SimCity creator Will Wright. Meanwhile, the teams behind App Store hits like Monument Valley , Florence , and Alto’s Adventure are all on board as well.  For the developers I spoke to, there’s a sense of cautious optimism around Apple Arcade and gaming subscription services, in general. For Apple, the company’s focus, as always, on offering a premium service holds a lot of appeal for game creators. “I’m heartened to see Apple devoting so much energy to maintaining and improving the quality of the App Store, especially while still keeping indie games solidly in the spotlight,” says indie developer Zach Gage . But with so many questions around the service, there are a lot of potential pitfalls as well.              One of the concerns for developers is that subscriptions could eliminate a large percentage of paid game sales, though there isn’t much historical precedence to determine whether this will happen. But it’s also a problem that could be alleviated by the design of the App Store itself; during Apple’s onstage demo, Arcade had its own tab in the store alongside Today, apps, games, and search. “This means that there is a chance that Apple Arcade may become another source of revenue for game developers, as opposed to replacing the existing ecosystem,” explains Adriaan de Jongh, co-creator of Hidden Folks .  Ever since the 2017 redesign of the App Store , Apple has put a large focus on editorial curation. This has been especially important for smaller indie developers fighting against the wave of free-to-play games since being featured in the App Store has the potential to turn a relatively unknown game into a hit. Apple appears to be using a similar tactic with Apple Arcade, focusing on beautifully designed titles, often from a fairly small pool of notable mobile developers. “It’s clear the Apple has a vision for the level of quality they want to set,” says Gage, “and they’re willing to stand up for the kind of content they think matters.”  For subscribers, this is great news. It means you know most of what’s available in Apple Arcade will be a high-quality experience. But it could present problems for those less-heralded developers who are looking to break in. And de Jongh says he’s worried the service will be “out of reach” for most mobile developers. “It is now more important than ever to be in conversations with the App Store team in order to even be considered to become part of that highest tier of games on the App Store,” he says. “As a developer of smaller games, I fear I can’t keep up.”  “As a developer of smaller games, I fear I can’t keep up.”  One of the key selling points of Apple Arcade is that it will feature games you can’t play elsewhere. Apple boasts that the service will offer “over 100 new and exclusive games.” Some of those games appear to be mobile exclusives — i.e., they may be available on console or PC but not Android — much in the same way that Epic has managed to lure PC exclusives to its fledgling store . But depending on the terms of the exclusivity deals with Apple, this could be an issue for developers in the long run.  Hidden Folks , for instance, started life as a mobile game, but it was able to find new players after expanding to Steam and the Nintendo Switch. And de Jongh says the App Store still makes up nearly half of all of the game’s revenue, but other platforms are crucial. “I truly hope games funded by Apple Arcade will be able to go to other places after a short amount of time so that developers don’t shoot themselves in the foot with a quick Apple Arcade cash grab,” he says.  All that said, subscription services like Apple Arcade appear to be an inevitability. Last week, Google announced its own Stadia streaming service , Microsoft has its increasingly appealing Xbox Game Pass , Sony continues to invest in PlayStation Now, and even Nintendo offers classic games and the occasional exclusive for Switch Online subscribers. “As a company we want to be at the forefront of the market evolutions and we are convinced that subscription-based models are one of the next steps of the industry,” says Alexandre de Rochefort, CFO at mobile publisher Gameloft, which is among the first batch of Apple Arcade partners.  Sean Krankel from Oxenfree developer Night School Studios says he’s “hopeful for the emergence of subscriptions, mainly because the relationship between players and the service is so clear.” The studio has more experience with the emerging field than most; Oxenfree is available through Game Pass, and the team is working on an unannounced game for Apple Arcade.  “It’s been awesome because our game is getting played by people who might not otherwise care about story games,” Krankel says. “So far it’s all been extremely positive for us.”      In this Storystream  Apple TV Plus: the latest developments from the keynote    Apple Arcade has game developers excited, but questions remain    Apple wants to be the only tech company you trust    View all 43 stories     Next Up In Gaming                         Most Read                  Apple announces Apple Card credit card  Coming summer 2019              Europe’s controversial overhaul of online copyright receives final approval  The much-criticized ‘upload filter’ and ‘link tax’ will soon become law in EU nations              The Apple Card is Apple’s thinnest and lightest status symbol ever  There was one hardware announcement at Apple’s services event              All the things Apple didn’t tell us about its streaming TV service  Apple TV Plus is more mysterious than familiar              Apple TV Plus and the new Apple TV app, explained  It’s easy to confuse all this Apple TV stuff                        Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.    email address...

A US trade judge has found Apple guilty of infringing on two Qualcomm patents related to power management and data download speeds. As a result, the judge — International Trade Commission Judge MaryJoan McNamara — says some iPhone models containing competing Intel modems might be blocked from shipping from China, where they’re manufactured, to the US.  The judgment is still pending review by the ITC. Qualcomm is expecting another ruling in a second case it brought to the ITC later today that is not expected to include an import ban on iPhones. Regardless, this ruling is another blow to Apple, which, earlier this month, was found to have infringed on three separate Qualcomm patents in one of many other legal skirmishes playing out between the two companies.  Qualcomm was given a paltry $31 million for that verdict , but the San Diego-based chipmaker has been steadily building its legal case and collecting small victories ahead of a larger, more definitive trial next month . That’s when both companies will battle over the core argument that’s created the tech industry’s biggest legal quagmire since Apple’s battle with Samsung. That argument involves Qualcomm’s alleged anti-competitive licensing strategies and the patent royalties it claims Apple owes for disputing the terms of their long-standing relationship.  Apple and Qualcomm’s legal battle wages on, with another trial next month  Apple and Qualcomm have been engaged in an industry-altering patent and licensing war stemming from a $1 billion lawsuit Apple filed more than two years ago . The original complaint has spiraled into a series of separate lawsuits involving patent infringement and countersuits aimed at pushing the legal battle into international territories, resulting in Qualcomm winning successful bans on older iPhone models in China and Germany.  All of this has led to a complete breakdown in the relationship between Apple and Qualcomm. The two companies previously had an exclusive licensing arrangement for the iPhone to use Qualcomm-made modems that are integral to bringing mobile devices online. In recent years, Apple has brought Intel into the fold as a modem supplier, and it appears that decision has had cascading effects that have led to today’s complex web of lawsuits. Qualcomm has also made the blockbuster claim that Apple effectively stole its technology and gave it to Intel , violating its patents in the process.  As a result of the feud, Apple has turned to Intel as the exclusive supplier of mobile modems for its iPhone line. Apple claims Qualcomm refused to sell it the parts it needed for its iPhone XS and XR line . The company may even be looking into building its own modem, according to recent job listings . Meanwhile, Qualcomm is still waiting for a final ruling in a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit over the same alleged anti-competitive practices that Apple says resulted in this entire mess in the first place.

Even the UK’s Royal Air Force is to put them into service as the P8a Poseidon .  An airplane which flies that much will have accidents. The 737 has had over 200 that have led to the loss of the airplane, resulting in over 5,000 fatalities over its 51 years.      Check out the lineup so far for TNW2019  Google, Reddit, and Slack will be there.   Join them    But statistically, this nonetheless is a very safe airplane. In the newer “Next Generation” 737, you’d have to take about a million flights to reach a 25% chance of being present at a “hull loss” accident (“hull loss” doesn’t even mean fatalities, just that the airplane is beyond economic repair ).  By comparison, the British annual average for road traffic fatalities is 13 per million inhabitants . In Britain, which has some of the world’s safest roads, your chance of dying as a car passenger per year are about four times greater than being in a serious accident if you fly in a Boeing 737 every month.  Evolution  Unsurprisingly, the Boeing 737, which has been with us for nearly half the time powered flight has existed, has seen many upgrades. The first model – the 737-100 – arrived in 1967, while the 737 MAX series entered service in 2016. So far, nearly 400 of the MAX aircraft have been delivered and over 5,000 ordered.  One of the earliest models, a Boeing 737-200, when it was in service with Ryanair. Guy Brian Gratton Over its lifetime, the 737 has stretched from 29 meters to 44 meters long, fuel capacity has risen from 14.7 tonnes to 21.3 tonnes, and passenger seats have increased from 118 to 230. With these developments have come demands for greater safety , reduced noise, particulate and greenhouse gas emissions , and lower running costs. So while all 737s are certified as a single airplane type , the changes have been massive.  Most recently, the big push has been to reduce fuel consumption. For both economic and environmental reasons, this led to the latest 737 MAX 8 models – along with the competitor Airbus A320 Neo – being fitted with new, larger and more efficient CFM Leap engines. These must be mounted higher and further forward than previously, creating a handling problem that wasn’t unique to this airplane, but had to be addressed.  One of the newer Boeing 737s, a 737-800 ‘Next Gen’ model ironically showing off a much older heritage livery for Dutch Airline KLM. Guy Brian Gratton Safety  Angle of attack is the angle between the wing chord (an imaginary line between the leading and trailing edges of the wing) and the airflow. To generate lift, this is typically around two degrees in cruising flight. But to create lift at low airspeeds during take-off, landing and some manoeuvers, it must be much higher – often more than ten degrees.  If the angle of attack is too great, the airplane loses control – or “stalls” . This has nothing to do with stalling an engine and will usually cause a sudden descent. The larger, repositioned engines initially created a handling problem at a high angle of attack, particularly at low speeds, which could pitch the airplane nose-up into an even greater angle of attack, potentially worsening the loss of control.  Boeing addressed this by introducing an automated system called Manoeuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) . This automatically forces the nose down from high angles of attack, removing the airplane from the stall condition. It does this by rotating the tailplane, effectively changing the shape of the airplane. This was necessary – stalling under these circumstances has been a serious, even fatal, problem in some previous airliners .  So far so good. But then we hit a problem which is alleged to have contributed to the October 2018 Lion Air 737 MAX 8 crash in Indonesia . While this aircraft had the MCAS system, the pilots allegedly didn’t know about it . It has been said a decision had been made not to include the system in pilot training , in particular that if the system received incorrect signals from the airplane’s angle of attack sensors the airplane could pitch steeply nose-down into a potentially unrecoverable dive.  All pilots train to recognize and deal with a wide range of instrument and equipment failures. On my own commercial pilots licence test, I had several real and simulated instrument failures, and was expected to deal with them while continuing the flight; all commercial pilots are reassessed on this regularly .  But pilots can best deal with failures they’ve been trained for. We don’t yet have full reports on the Lion Air crash, nor on the more recent Ethiopian Airlines crash of another 737 MAX. But there is growing evidence that the crew didn’t fully understand the MCAS system, and that the system could malfunction when a single instrument feeding it information fails . The airplane could allegedly put itself into a steep dive due to an instrument failure, and the pilots perhaps weren’t fully trained to recognize and correct for that .  What next?  In a very new aircraft type, 339 people have died in two, apparently similar, accidents – this is intolerable. Fortunately, the aviation industry, that’s mindset often goes back to the 1950s Comet disasters , is extremely prompt in dealing with serious safety issues.  Around the world, airplanes of this type were grounded within a few days, and will remain so until Boeing and its stakeholders find and certify solutions to both the aircraft control software and the pilot training issues.  American budget airline giant Southwest has built its business model around the Boeing 737, currently operating 750 of them. The FAA[index company=FAANews] has grounded their 35 737 MAX airplanes. Guy Brian Gratton These events show the aviation industry at both its best, and worst. It’s right that manufacturers and airlines should be seeking more efficient, safer aircraft. But making progress at an acceptable cost could potentially risk corners being cut.  In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been accused in the past of delegating too much oversight of their own work to Boeing , and those of us in this community are concerned that when governments seek to reduce budgets, aviation authorities may not be well enough resourced to adequately do their jobs.  Additionally, any aviation company may necessarily suffer conflict between engineers and pilots, whose objective is to create the best and safest product, and business managers, who must ensure profitability.  So what now? The 737 MAX will remain grounded while Boeing develops a “software fix” that eliminates this potential problem, and then works with the FAA and international authorities to certify it. There should also be new MCAS training that all 737 MAX pilots around the world will receive before they fly the airplane again. Indeed, this will hopefully also lead to a broader debate about the level of training provided to airline pilots.  After these two tragedies there will likely be a number of court cases. The families will rightly want closure. But we also need to ensure that similar disasters don’t happen in the future – and this involves aviation professionals working to find new safety solutions. Focusing too much on legal outcomes could potentially prevent the best safety outcomes from being pursued .

Chris Lee - Mar 26, 2019 6:07 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Eugene Wigner first came up with the thought experiment this real experiment is based on.

Cue sighs of tired dread from physicists everywhere as they wonder what otherwise bland result has been spun out of control.  In this case, though, it turns out that the paper and the underlying theory are much more interesting than that takeaway. Essentially, modern physics tells us that two observers of the same event may never agree on the result, even if they have all possible knowledge. This is already accepted as part of special relativity, but now we have experimental proof that it applies to quantum mechanics as well.   What Galileo and Einstein tell us  Let’s start with the simplest possible example of how we typically resolve conflicting measurements. I am standing on a platform and measure the speed of an approaching train to be 180km/hr. You are on the train and measure the speed of the train to be 0km/hr. We can resolve the difference by making an additional measurement on our relative speeds. Afterward, we both know that we’ve measured the speed correctly relative to our own motion.   The situation gets more complex for very fast-moving objects. Imagine a pole vaulter with a 100-meter-long pole trying to fit the entire pole into a building that is only 30 meters long. Impossible you say? Well that depends on the relative speed between the two. If the pole vaulter approaches the building at near the speed of light, an observer in the building will measure the pole to only be 20 meters long. The observer will decide that the pole was, for a very short time, contained by the building.  But the pole vaulter will measure the pole to be 100 meters long at all times and the building to be about 20 meters long. Nope, that pole doesn’t fit.   When the observers compare, the outcome is different for the pole vaulter example from the train example. An additional measurement on our relative speed can explain why the two observers see different outcomes. But nothing can tell us if the pole was ever completely in the building or not. One observer knows the pole fits in the building and one knows that it doesn’t.  The key to dealing with this discrepancy is accepting that you may not be able to resolve different measurement outcomes, and instead you have to figure out the circumstances that make a specific conclusion valid.  Quantum observers  Quantum mechanics takes this idea to a whole new level because the concept of a measurement is different. Let’s take the specific example of the polarization of a photon. We don’t need to know what the polarization is, only that it has an orientation in space (e.g, vertical, horizontal, diagonal, etc.).  For a single photon, we can’t actually measure the polarization. Instead, we can only ask: are you vertically polarized? The answer is either ""yes, I’m vertical,"" or ""no, I’m horizontal."" The point is that I (the measurer) first make a choice of two orientations, and the photon will always be found in one of those two orientations.  Let's now say I choose to measure at 45 degrees. A vertically polarized photon, from the perspective of the measurement apparatus , is in a mixture—called a superposition state—of two polarization states: +45 degrees and -45 degrees. But once the measurement is performed, the photon has to choose one of those states. From the perspective of the measurer, we never know that the photon was in a superposition state. We only know that we measured +45 degrees.  What Wigner tells us  Now let’s complicate things even more. You are measuring a stream of photons that are in a superposition state. So every measurement has a 50-percent chance of reporting a vertical photon and a 50-percent chance of reporting a horizontal photon. You, however, are in a box and cannot report your measurements to me. Instead, I have to measure your state to discover the result of your measurement.  That means you are in a superposition state of having measured a vertical or horizontal photon, even after you have made the measurement . I can measure your state, and we end up with two sensible outcomes: you measure horizontal, and I measure you to have measured horizontal; you measure vertical and I measure you to have measured vertical.  But there are two more possibilities: you measure horizontal, but I measure you to have measured vertical, and you measure vertical, but I measure you to have measured horizontal. If the second measurement is governed by quantum mechanics, those two are just as likely to occur as the sensible outcomes. So half the time, the measurement result you obtain contradicts my measurement of your measurement.  There is nothing wrong with either measurement, and there is no calculation that we can perform to resolve the contradiction. We simply have to accept that the photon is both definitely horizontally polarized and definitely vertically polarized.   This thought experiment, first outlined by Eugene Wigner, has now been realized in a real experiment. It was a bit complicated to implement. Essentially, the experiment's researchers set up an apparatus that makes measurements on polarization that, if successful, leave a record of the measurement encoded in a second photon. Thus, between the original measurement and a new one done on the second photon, we have a simple version of the Wigner experiment.  As predicted by the theory, the setup records cases where the measurement and the measurement of the measurement disagree. Indeed, the rate of agreement/disagreement is pretty much exactly as predicted by quantum mechanics.  The conclusion, according to the researchers, is that there are no facts that do not depend on the observer. Or coarsely put, at the quantum level, you may have the option of choosing your own facts.  I don’t see this result as startling. We already know that there are no privileged observers in special relativity, so why should they exist in quantum mechanics? Indeed, the thought experiment that presented us with this dilemma told us that measurement outcomes will depend on who is doing the measuring. And now we have experimental proof that this is so.  It doesn’t say anything about reality, though.  arXiv.org , 2019, arXiv ID: 1902.05080v1 ( About the arXiv ).

Photo: Sarah Shatz/CBS ©2019 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.     Measles appeared as the villain in the latest episode of the CBS show Madam Secretary . The story arc captured the risks of vaccine hesitancy — and it showcases the power of a fictional TV show to communicate facts.  The episode is timely given measles’ presence in the news lately. Outbreaks have been spreading across the country , and tech giants Facebook, Google, and Amazon have come under fire for allowing anti-vaccine misinformation to spread on their platforms. But the timing is just a coincidence, according to the show’s executive producer David Grae . Even before measles started making news in 2019, the Madam Secretary team had an episode about vaccine hesitancy in the works. “We all know about this idea of anti-vaxxing and how dangerous it is,” Grae says. “The idea that we could lose our herd immunity — we really need responsible leadership around the world to make sure that doesn’t happen.”  “We all know about this idea of anti-vaxxing and how dangerous it is.”  One of the main storylines in the episode centers on the Secretary of State’s press coordinator Daisy Grant (played by Patina Miller ), who comes back from a cruise only to wind up in quarantine with her young daughter Joanna. They discover that Joanna’s friend, another child on the cruise, hadn’t been vaccinated and became infected with measles during the trip. Joanna had received one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which the show explains is 93 percent effective : Joanna falls into that remaining 7 percent. She pulls through, but Joanna’s unvaccinated friend suffers from a measles complication called encephalitis that gives her brain damage.

A post shared by Madam Secretary (@madamsecretarycbs) on Mar 24, 2019 at 10:01pm PDT     Madam Secretary is, of course, fiction. But fiction may be a good vector for fact — at least, when it’s done right, according to Beth Hoffman , a research assistant at the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Research on Media, Technology, and Health. Hoffman and her colleagues are looking into what viewers learn from medical storylines on television. And in a few different papers, they report that TV shows are especially good at engaging students and the general public , for better or for worse.  “Entertainment narratives have an effect on viewers’ perception, knowledge, and ultimately their health behavior.”  In one paper, they dug through the scientific literature to find a handful of studies investigating what viewers take away from medical dramas like Grey’s Anatomy . There aren’t many studies out there. But their review of the research, published in the journal Health Education Research in 2017 , reports that people do absorb medical messaging from TV and might sometimes even change their behaviors based on what they see on screen. “Entertainment narratives have an effect on viewers’ perception, knowledge, and ultimately their health behavior,” Hoffman says. While she doesn’t know of any studies about vaccine messaging in particular, she says, “There’s good reason to think that storylines about vaccine-preventable diseases can have a positive influence on individuals’ perception of vaccination.”  Madam Secretary ’s Grae says the whole team felt that responsibility and wanted to get their facts right — particularly when they surround a contentious issue like vaccines. “It wouldn’t be artistically responsible to leave room for, ‘Oh well maybe it’s okay not to vaccinate,’” he says. “And when you want to get it exactly right, Googling isn’t enough. It’s never enough when you have real-world issues.”  “It wouldn’t be artistically responsible to leave room for, ‘Oh well maybe it’s okay not to vaccinate.’”  So the show’s writers turned to Hollywood, Health & Society , a program at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Norman Lear Center that helps bridge the gap between the entertainment industry and experts in health, science, and security. (There’s also a similar program at the National Academies of Sciences called the Science and Entertainment Exchange .) “We understand it’s fiction and we have to take some liberties,” says Kate Folb , director of Hollywood, Health & Society. But it’s important for public health information to be as accurate as possible, she says. “We don’t want to misinform audiences, because we know that they’ll act upon it.”  There are a few theories about why that is, Folb says. One is that immersion in a plot helps lower viewers’ intellectual defenses. “You’re rooting for your hero, you’re running through the forest with them. You’re right there with them,” Folb says. “So if and when information is presented, it sinks in on a much deeper level.” The other theory is that viewers may identify with and believe characters they connect with on TV shows, she says — which is why it’s so important for public health and science information to be as accurate as possible. “Because it’s soaking in when you’re watching it,” she says.  “We understand it’s fiction and we have to take some liberties.”  Vaccine expert Peter Hotez , dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, says he’s consulted with Hollywood, Health & Society before, but wasn’t involved in this episode. And save for some minor quibbles — such as about the low likelihood of Joanna contracting measles even though she’d had a single dose of the vaccine — he applauded the way the episode handled measles and vaccine hesitancy. “It was really helpful that they showed measles as it is: as a serious disease,” he says. “They didn’t try to dismiss it as a benign illness or just a rash, and that’s an important point.”  The episode tackled a lot of important issues surrounding measles and vaccines, including misinformation, Hotez says. In the episode, the mom of the little girl who suffers brain complications from measles explains why she didn’t vaccinate her daughter. She’d thought measles had been completely eradicated from the US , and she was afraid of vaccinations because of articles she’d read. “There were all these articles about possible harm from vaccines, and then a study saying there was no proof, and then you read another article — and you don’t know what to think,” the mom says in the show.  “You don’t reach people by scolding them.”  The show’s writers and the characters they created treat this family with kindness: the parents aren’t blamed for infecting another child, or ridiculed for believing anti-vaccine propaganda. They’re treated as parents who want to do what’s best for their child, and who were misled by the proliferation of scaremongering anti-vaccination propaganda that’s out there. That was partly to stay true to the show’s recurring characters, and partly a conscious choice the Madam Secretary team made after talking with the experts at Hollywood, Health & Society, Grae says. “You don’t reach people by scolding them. You reach people by kindly explaining the truth without scolding or telling people they’re stupid.”  Reaching people is something TV is especially good at, says Hotez, who wrote a book about being a vaccine researcher and the parent of a child with autism called Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism . “Let’s face it. At the end of the day, many more people are going to watch this episode of Madam Secretary than are going to read my book,” he says.  The episode ends with a public service announcement, where Téa Leoni , who plays the Secretary of State, tells viewers to go to https://www.unicefusa.org/vax for more information. Ultimately, the team’s goal is to make a dramatic show, but in this case, they also had the chance to educate people. “That’s a win-win, that’s good for everybody. So we’re happy to do it,” Grae says.

Jon Brodkin - Mar 26, 2019 4:47 pm UTC         Enlarge Verizon     reader comments  76  with 58 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      The advertising industry's self-regulatory division has urged Verizon to stop claiming that it has America's first 5G network, but Verizon claims that its ""first to 5G"" commercials are not misleading and is appealing the decision.  The National Advertising Division (NAD), an investigative unit managed by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, announced its recommendation to Verizon last week. The NAD investigated after a challenge lodged by AT&T, which has been misleading customers itself by renaming large portions of its 4G network to ""5G E."" But AT&T's challenge of Verizon's 5G ads was ""the first case involving advertising for 5G"" to come before the self-regulatory body, the NAD said. Further Reading AT&T’s “5G E” is actually slower than Verizon and T-Mobile 4G, study finds  Specifically, AT&T challenged three Verizon commercials that included claims that Verizon is "" first to 5G "" and that it has launched America's ""only 5G ultra wideband network."" While "" ultra wideband "" does refer to real radio technology, it's more of a marketing term when Verizon uses it in the context of 5G. Verizon doesn't even always use that qualifier to describe its future 5G service—at one point, this commercial says Verizon is ""building America's first 5G network"" without the ultra wideband language.  Verizon: ""First to 5G""  The problem is, Verizon hasn't launched any mobile 5G service, despite these ads being around since September 2018. Verizon plans to launch 5G mobile service in April, but it will initially be available only in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis and be usable only with a single Motorola phone via a hardware adapter. Despite those limitations, it'll cost $10 more per month than Verizon 4G service.  Verizon does offer a ""5G"" home Internet service in a few cities, but it's initially based on Verizon's own 5G technology instead of the industry's 5G standard, and the early rollout has reportedly been disappointingly small.  NAD: Ads' message not supported by evidence  The NAD's announcement of its ruling said the following:  NAD found that one message reasonably conveyed by the stories told in these commercials, and by some of the claims, is that Verizon has achieved the important milestone of deploying the first mobile wireless 5G network. Although NAD acknowledged that the commercials' featured stories are told in the past and future tenses, it noted that each also featured a Verizon engineer talking about Verizon's network in the present tense, using words such as now and today .  NAD concluded that by discussing the historic achievements that Verizon has already made in the field of mobile wireless technology in conjunction with present-tense claims such as ""First to 5G,"" ""building America's first and only 5G ultra wideband network,"" ""… once again, we're transforming reliability as we know it, building America's first and only 5G ultra wideband network, with unprecedented capacity enabling faster speeds,"" and ""Now, with the launch of the only 5G ultra wideband network, we're doing it again…"", Verizon reasonably conveys the unintended, and unsupported, message that 5G mobile service is currently available.  NAD also found that Verizon's advertising conveyed a comparative message. If, as advertised, Verizon is ""First to 5G"", NAD determined that this necessarily means that its competitors may be second or third.  The NAD recommended that Verizon's commercials ""be discontinued or modified in order to avoid conveying certain messages, including the unintended message that Verizon has launched [a] 5G mobile wireless network.""  The NAD press release also explains why it found Verizon's defense unconvincing:  While Verizon argued that the ""first and only 5G network"" claims are limited to its ""ultra wideband network"" and, thus, qualified to avoid conveying the message that Verizon is the nation's only 5G network, NAD disagreed. Verizon explained that it is building the nation's only ""ultra wideband"" network based on three exclusive features of its current network: its unrefuted wide spectrum holdings, deep fiber resources, and the ability to deploy large numbers of small cells. However, NAD noted, Verizon's claim, ""America's first and only 5G ultra wideband network"" is not linked directly to the exclusive technology or benefits Verizon is claiming to provide. Consequently, to the extent that Verizon wants to use its ""first and only ultra wideband network"" claim, it can do so if it ties this claim directly to its unique technology or performance benefits.  Verizon: The ads show “corporate pride”  The NAD noted that a recommendation to modify or discontinue ads ""is not a finding of wrongdoing,"" and these recommendations have no legal force. But the system of self-regulation has halted many misleading ads because advertisers generally follow NAD recommendations.  Companies can appeal NAD recommendations to the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which is also part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Verizon said it will do so.  Verizon's response to the recommendation said it ""believes NAD failed to properly evaluate the net impression of the challenged commercials"" and ""disagrees that the challenged claims or net impression of the commercials at issue convey anything more than corporate pride in its achievements and the development of its next generation 5G Ultra-Wideband Network.""  Verizon also said it ""disagrees that reasonable consumers are likely to misunderstand its claims about its '5G Ultra-wideband network,' which is unique from networks under development by other carriers.""  Verizon in January pledged that it won't falsely claim that 4G phones are really 5G, in response to AT&T changing phone network indicators from 4G to 5G E despite not providing any 5G smartphone service. AT&T has rolled out mobile 5G in parts of 12 cities, but for now it's only usable with a single Netgear hotspot .  We wouldn't be surprised to see future NAD cases involving AT&T's 5G E claims, but AT&T is already facing a false advertising lawsuit filed by Sprint.                reader comments  76  with 58 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

This is arguably the most profound question there is and one that may seem completely outside the scope of particle physics. But our new experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider has taken us a step closer to figuring it out.  To understand why, let’s go back in time some 13.8 billion years to the Big Bang. This event produced equal amounts of the matter you are made of and something called antimatter . It is believed that every particle has an antimatter companion that is virtually identical to itself, but with the opposite charge. When a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate each other – disappearing in a burst of light.      TNW Conference is coming up in Amsterdam  You should definitely be there   See why    Why the universe we see today is made entirely out of matter is one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics. Had there ever been an equal amount of antimatter, everything in the universe would have been annihilated. Our research has unveiled a new source of this asymmetry between matter and antimatter.  Antimatter was first postulated by Arthur Schuster in 1896, given a theoretical footing by Paul Dirac in 1928, and discovered in the form of anti-electrons, dubbed positrons, by Carl Anderson in 1932. The positrons occur in natural radioactive processes, such as in the decay of Potassium-40. This means your average banana (which contains Potassium) emits a positron every 75 minutes. These then annihilate with matter electrons to produce light. Medical applications like PET scanners produce antimatter in the same process.  The fundamental building blocks of matter that make up atoms are elementary particles called quarks and leptons. There are six kinds of quarks : up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top. Similarly, there are six leptons : the electron, muon, tau and the three neutrinos. There are also antimatter copies of these twelve particles that differ only in their charge.  Antimatter particles should in principle be perfect mirror images of their normal companions. But experiments show this isn’t always the case. Take for instance particles known as mesons , which are made of one quark and one anti-quark. Neutral mesons have a fascinating feature: they can spontaneously turn into their anti-meson and vice versa. In this process, the quark turns into an anti-quark or the anti-quark turns into a quark. But experiments have shown that this can happen more in one direction than the opposite one – creating more matter than antimatter over time.  Third time’s a charm  Among particles containing quarks, only those including strange and bottom quarks have been found to exhibit such asymmetries – and these were hugely important discoveries. The very first observation of asymmetry involving strange particles in 1964 allowed theorists to predict the existence of six quarks – at a time when only three were known to exist. The discovery of asymmetry in bottom particles in 2001 was the final confirmation of the mechanism that led to the six-quark picture. Both discoveries led to Nobel Prizes.  LHCb. Maximilien Brice et al./CERN Both the strange and bottom quark carry a negative electric charge. The only positively charged quark that in theory should be able to form particles that can exhibit matter-antimatter asymmetry is charm. Theory suggests that if it does, then the effect should be tiny and difficult to detect.  But the LHCb experiment has now managed to observe such an asymmetry in particles called D-meson – which are comprised of charm quarks – for the first time. This is made possible by the unprecedented amount of charm particles produced directly in the LHC collisions, which I pioneered a decade ago. The result indicates that the chance of this being a statistical fluctuation is about 50 in a billion.  If this asymmetry is not coming from the same mechanism causing the strange and bottom quark asymmetries, this leaves room for new sources of matter-antimatter asymmetry that can add to the total such asymmetry in the early universe. And that’s important as the few known cases of asymmetry can’t explain why the universe contains so much matter. The charm discovery alone will not be sufficient to fill this gap, but it is an essential puzzle piece in the understanding of the interactions of fundamental particles.  Next steps  The discovery will be followed by an increased number of theoretical works, which help to interpret the result. But more importantly, it will outline further tests to deepen the understanding following our finding – with a number of such tests already ongoing.  Over the coming decade, the upgraded LHCb experiment will boost the sensitivity for these kinds of measurements. This will be complemented by the Japan-based Belle II experiment , which is just starting to operate. These are exciting prospects for research into matter-antimatter asymmetry.  Antimatter is also at the heart of a number of other experiments. Whole anti-atoms are being produced at CERN’s Antiproton Decelerator , which feeds a number of experiments conducting high precision measurements. The AMS-2 experiment aboard the International Space Station is on the lookout for antimatter of cosmic origin. And a number of current and future experiments will tackle the question of whether there is antimatter-matter asymmetry among neutrinos.  While we still cannot completely solve the mystery of the universe’s matter-antimatter asymmetry, our latest discovery has opened the door to an era of precision measurements that have the potential to uncover yet unknown phenomena. There’s every reason to be optimistic that physics will one day be able to explain why we are here at all.

Again, they're completely cable-free, drawing battery from a pillbox-like charging case, with stem-like protrusions from the buds. But the next-gen improvements are under the hood. First up is a newly-designed H1 chip which Apple has built specifically for the headphones. It improves connectivity pairing times, as well as the efficiency of the battery life, which Apple claims will give you 50% more hands-free talk time. The original AirPods offered five hours of use, with a total 24 hours of battery life when taking into consideration their charging case, for comparison. Image Credit: Apple Beyond battery life, the most significant addition is that of hands-free ""Hey Siri"" functionality. Pop the AirPods 2 into your ears, and you'll be able to use the voice assistant command to place calls, change songs and more – basically anything Siri can do, direct from the AirPods 2, without needing to pull your iPhone out. The AirPods 2 ship with a charging case, though Apple is also introducing a new Wireless Charging Case for the earbuds, using Qi-compatible charging mats to power the case without you having to stick a cable in. This is, presumably, in anticipation of the launch of Apple's long-awaited Air Power charging mat . The new Wireless Charging Case will also be compatible with the first-generation AirPods. As for sound quality, Apple has yet to reveal any differences between the generations. We'll update you on how the AirPods 2 sound once we've given them a listen. AirPods 2 price and availability The AirPods 2 are available now, priced at $159 / £159 / AU$249 / AED679 with the standard charging case, and $199 / £199 / AU$319 / AED829 with the new Wireless Charging Case bundled in. The Wireless Charging Case can also be bought separately for $79 / £79 / AU$129 / AED329. If you're feeling particularly swish, you can add a personal engraving to the cases at checkout on Apple.com . What didn't make the cut? Previous trademark filings suggested that the second generation AirPods would be a health and fitness device, in addition to being a pair of true wireless earbuds. Back in July 2018 Apple filed a patent for biometric sensors which would allow the AirPods 2 to take on fitness tracking capabilities like those seen in the Jabra Elite Wireless . This followed another patent filed in March , which further fuelled the rumors. But Apple hasn't made any mention of any biometric features in the new AirPods 2, so it's likely either Apple changed course over the development of the AirPods 2, or is holding some features back for another iteration further down the line. We also heard separately that the AirPods 2 would come in black and white, be both waterproof and offer active noise-cancellation. Another patent from July suggested that Apple was working on some pretty nifty tech for how the earbuds handle outside noise as well as dissipating pressure from inside the ear canal. The patent outlined a valve system that would allow sound to escape your ear canal to avoid that weird reverberating effect that occurs when you speak with earbuds in your ears. It then goes on to describe how the earbuds would handle ambient noise, using a microphone to filter in noise from the outside world so that you can remain aware of your surroundings while still hearing your music. But these rumors also don't appear to have manifested in the final product. Apple also hasn't made any mention of improved sound quality, but we will let you know how they sound as soon as we get our hands on them. One rumor that did prove to be accurate however was wireless charging and Bluetooth 5.0 - but instead of being an improved thanks to an updated W2 chip, Apple has designed a brand new H1 chip, which is made for headphones specifically.

By  Rani Molla @ranimolla    Mar 21, 2019,  2:46pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Money-losing companies that went public in 2018 did better than profitable ones      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Javier Zarracina/Vox     Public investors are doing something counterintuitive: They’re valuing unprofitable companies higher than they are profitable ones that entered public stock exchanges last year. Those are the findings from a new PitchBook report on the stock performance of US unicorns .  The study looked at the median stock-price change for startups valued at more than a billion dollars when they went public.  For the unprofitable* ones that went public in 2018, their median stock-price growth has been 120 percent on an annualized basis, from the IPO offering price through March 12 of this year. The median decline for stocks that were profitable has been 57 percent for 2018.  DocuSign, for example, has been consistently unprofitable before and after its April 2018 IPO. It’s currently trading at about $57, well above its $29 offer price.**  In general over the past nine years, profitability has barely made a difference for performance.  A couple big caveats here: Only a couple of the 20 US unicorns that went public last year were profitable, so the sample size is very small. Also, since this data is looking at compound annual growth rates, big jumps or dives in price for first-year stocks will look more inflated than they will likely be over time. Still, the money-losing companies that dominate the sample are doing relatively well enough to show there’s a definite public appetite for them.       “In general, you’re not seeing a huge preference either way in public markets for if a company has been profitable or unprofitable at its IPO,” Cameron Stanfill, an analyst at PitchBook and the report’s author, told Recode .  That says more about the market than the companies and means that investors are prizing future growth over present profitability.  “They believe in the business model and are disregarding the current state of profitability at the IPO,” Stanfill said.  That’s the same as with some private investors and venture capitalists, who are taking these companies public in the first place. Indeed, unprofitable companies are going public at a record rate , one not seen since the dot-com bubble.  Of course, the dot-com bubble did eventually burst, so it’s difficult not to see this latest round of unprofitable IPOs as grim tidings.  However, there are a few stark differences.  Many unprofitable companies could be profitable if they switched their focus from growth to profit. Spotify has long said it could be profitable if it weren’t trying to grow . It recently became profitable for the first time , less than a year after it was listed on the stock market. Lyft — for a 2019 example — could have had a positive net last year if it didn’t spend any money on advertising or R&D. Not spending that money, however, would stop it from gaining more customers. It would also stunt the company’s dream of developing a future of driverless cars, a plan that could see Lyft taking a bigger cut of revenue.  The companies that are going public lately — basically all of which are tech or biotech companies — are also older and have more established revenue streams and business models than their dot-com counterparts. Lyft generated $2.2 billion in revenue last year, a sum unimaginable to the internet companies of the late ’90s.  Still, when a recession hits, likely within the next two years , the crowd will certainly be thinned.  “Those that are profitable will potentially be in a better position,” Stanfill said. “A company is more defensible in downturn if it’s making a profit.”  * PitchBook is looking at IPO profitability using Ebitda margins, which add back in interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. True profit would be lower.  ** These price changes are from the offering price through March 12, 2019. The offering price is the usually lower price institutional investors buy stock at right before it’s traded on the public market.

Ron Miller,technology,"                        Adobe announces deeper data sharing partnership with Microsoft around accounts     Ron Miller  10 hours         Microsoft and Adobe have been building a relationship for some time, and today at Adobe Summit in Las Vegas the two companies announced a deeper integration between the two platforms.  It involves sharing Marketo data, the company that Adobe acquired last September for $4.75 billion. Because it’s marketers, they were duty-bound to give it a new name. This data-sharing approach is being dubbed Account Based Experience, or ABX for short. The two companies are sharing data account data between a number of sources, including Marketo Engage in Adobe Experience Cloud and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales, as well as the LinkedIn, the business social platform Microsoft  bought in 2016 for a whopping $26.2 billion .  Microsoft has been trying to find ways to put that LinkedIn data to work, and tools like Marketo can use the data in LinkedIn to understand their account contacts better. Steve Lucas, former CEO at Marketo, who is now senior vice president and head of the Marketo team at Adobe, says accounts tend to be much more complex sales than selling to individuals, involving multiple decision makers. It’s a sales cycle that can stretch on for months, and having access to additional data about the account contacts can have a big impact.  “With these new account-based capabilities, marketing and sales teams will have increased alignment around the people and accounts they are engaging, and new ways to measure that business impact,” Lucas explained in a statement.  Brent Leary, principal at CRM Essentials, who has been working in CRM, customer service and marketing for years, sees this as a useful partnership for customers from both vendors. “Integrating Microsoft Dynamics and LinkedIn more closely with Marketo gives Adobe’s Experience Cloud some great data to leverage in order to have a more complete picture of B2B customers,” Leary told TechCrunch.  The goal is to close complex sales, and having access to more complete data across the two product sets can help achieve that.

Samuel Axon     reader comments  14  with 14 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a deal on Roku's Streaming Stick+, which is currently down to $49 at Walmart and Amazon . While not the absolute cheapest it's ever been, it's the 4K media streamer's typical discount price and a good savings from the usual going rate of $59. Walmart's deal also includes a three-month subscription to CBS' All Access streaming service, so if you've been interested in checking out Star Trek: Discovery , consider it a nice kicker.  Further Reading Roku Ultra and Streaming Stick+ review: High-end streaming with low-end frills We reviewed the Streaming Stick+ back in late 2017. To sum it up: the Streaming Stick+ lacks the Dolby Vision HDR support of Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and can't quite match the voice search capabilities of that device's built-in Alexa assistant, but it still runs well, works with HDR10, and is easy to set up. Perhaps most importantly, Roku's device interface doesn't funnel you toward certain services and programs the way Amazon or Apple tend to do. The UI could stand to get a makeover, but even if it looks bland, it stays relatively neutral in letting you use the apps you prefer to use. Unlike Roku's cheaper Premiere streamers , the Streaming Stick+ also supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi, which should keep it from buffering as much as those other devices might.  If you don't need a 4K media streamer, though, this week's Dealmaster also has a big Gold Box sale on gaming accessories at Amazon, a number of Apple device discounts, deals on Fire tablets, and more. Have a look for yourself below.  Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .

Jon Brodkin - Mar 25, 2019 8:50 pm UTC         Enlarge  / ""Yarr, matey, a pirate would be lost at sea without a swift broadband connection."" Getty Images | OcusFocus     reader comments  242  with 167 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      The music industry is suing Charter Communications, claiming that the cable Internet provider profits from music piracy by failing to terminate the accounts of subscribers who illegally download copyrighted songs. The lawsuit also complains that Charter helps its subscribers pirate music by selling packages with higher Internet speeds.  While the act of providing higher Internet speeds clearly isn't a violation of any law, ISPs can be held liable for their users' copyright infringement if the ISPs repeatedly fail to disconnect repeat infringers.  The top music labels—Sony, Universal, Warner, and their various subsidiaries—sued Charter Friday in a complaint filed in US District Court in Colorado. While Charter has a copyright policy that says repeat copyright infringers may be disconnected, Charter has failed to disconnect those repeat infringers in practice, the complaint said:  Despite these alleged policies, and despite receiving hundreds of thousands of infringement notices from Plaintiffs, as well as thousands of similar notices from other copyright owners, Charter knowingly permitted specifically identified repeat infringers to continue to use its network to infringe. Rather than disconnect the Internet access of blatant repeat infringers to curtail their infringement, Charter knowingly continued to provide these subscribers with the Internet access that enabled them to continue to illegally download or distribute Plaintiffs' copyrighted works unabated. Charter's provision of high-speed Internet service to known infringers materially contributed to these direct infringements.  The complaint accuses Charter of contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement. Music labels asked for statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each work infringed or for actual damages including any profit Charter allegedly made from allowing piracy. The complaint focuses on alleged violations between March 24, 2013 and May 17, 2016.  During that time, plaintiffs say they sent infringement notices to Charter that ""advised Charter of its subscribers' blatant and systematic use of Charter's Internet service to illegally download, copy, and distribute Plaintiffs' copyrighted music through BitTorrent and other online file-sharing services."" The music industry's complaint repeatedly focused on BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer networks, saying that ""online piracy committed via BitTorrent is stunning in nature, speed, and scope.""  Lawsuit: High speeds enabled piracy  The music labels' complaint also seems to describe the basic acts of providing Internet service and advertising high speeds as nefarious:  Many of Charter's customers are motivated to subscribe to Charter's service because it allows them to download music and other copyrighted content—including unauthorized content—as efficiently as possible. Accordingly, in its consumer marketing material, including material directed to Colorado customers, Charter has touted how its service enables subscribers to download and upload large amounts of content at ""blazing-fast Internet speeds."" Charter has told existing and prospective customers that its high-speed service enables subscribers to ""download just about anything instantly,"" and subscribers have the ability to ""download 8 songs in 3 seconds."" Charter has further told subscribers that its Internet service ""has the speed you need for everything you do online."" In exchange for this service, Charter has charged its customers monthly fees ranging in price based on the speed of service.  That paragraph from the music labels' complaint merely describes the standard business model of Internet providers. There is nothing illegal about offering higher Internet speeds in exchange for higher prices.  But the labels also allege that Charter's lax approach to copyright enforcement helped it earn more revenue, in part because piracy supposedly inspired consumers to subscribe to faster Internet tiers.  ""For those account holders and subscribers who wanted to download files illegally at faster speeds, Charter obliged them in exchange for higher rates. In other words, the greater the bandwidth its subscribers required for pirating content, the more money Charter made,"" the complaint said. Further Reading Rightscorp wins landmark ruling, Cox hit with $25M verdict in copyright case  The complaint argues that, while Charter performs network management to block ""spam and other unwanted activity,"" the ISP ""has gone out of its way not to take action against subscribers engaging in repeated copyright infringement.""  ""Charter condoned the illegal activity, because it was popular with subscribers and acted as a draw to attract and retain new and existing subscribers. Charter's customers, in turn, purchased more bandwidth and continued using Charter's services to infringe Plaintiffs' copyrights,"" the complaint said. ""Charter undoubtedly recognized that if it terminated or otherwise prevented repeat infringer subscribers from using its service to infringe or made it less attractive for such use, Charter would enroll fewer new subscribers, lose existing subscribers, and ultimately lose revenue.""  Infringement notices that music labels send to Charter and other ISPs identify violators by their IP addresses.  ""Because the copyright holders could only determine the unique IP addresses of an ISP's infringing subscribers but not their actual identities, they served subpoenas on Charter and other ISPs to obtain the infringing subscribers' names and contact information,"" the complaint said. ""Although Charter's customer agreements allowed it to produce that information and no real doubt existed as to their customers' underlying infringement, Charter vigorously opposed the subpoenas, undermining the record companies' efforts to curb direct infringement activity.""  When contacted by Ars, a Charter spokesperson said, ""We will defend against these baseless allegations."" We asked Charter if it ever terminates the accounts of alleged copyright infringers, but the company provided no answer.  Industry has sued several ISPs  The record companies last week also sued Charter subsidiary Bright House Networks in US District Court in the Middle District of Florida, a TorrentFreak article noted. Music labels had previously sued ISPs such as Cox and Grande Communications.  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, ISPs cannot be held liable for Internet users' copyright infringement if the ISPs ""'adopt and reasonably implement' a repeat infringer policy that provides for termination of users' accounts 'in appropriate circumstances,'"" an EFF explainer notes. But the law is vague enough that courts have had to interpret its meaning in various cases over the years.  In 2013, AT&T and other ISPs began using a "" six-strikes "" Copyright Alert System, working in conjunction with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The system ended up doing little to thwart copyright infringement and was shut down early last year . Further Reading AT&T steps up copyright enforcement, kicks customers off network  Music publishers have called on ISPs to filter out pirated content, and they have filed various lawsuits against ISPs. Cox lost a jury verdict in a music piracy case in 2015. Another lawsuit involving Cox was settled last year, but Cox faces yet another lawsuit filed in August 2018 .  In the Grande case , a federal judge this month ruled that Grande does not qualify for a legal safe harbor because of the ISP's ""complete abdication of [its] responsibilities to implement and enforce a policy terminating repeat copyright infringers.""  While ISPs have often resisted disconnecting alleged pirates, AT&T recently terminated the broadband service of more than a dozen customers who were accused multiple times of copyright infringement.  Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 13 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications. Advance Publications owns Condé Nast, which owns Ars Technica.

As you can see here, the SYMFONISK looks like... well, a Sonos speaker with IKEA design cues.  Its boxy, fabric-covered style appears to be a fitting complement to your plywood tables and cabinets.  The company even suggests that it could serve as a wall-mounted shelf (below), although that would make it an awfully expensive part of your decor.            There are still many unknowns, such as the audio quality and price, although their compatibility with IKEA's other smart home devices suggests they might not be entry-level.  You might only have to wait until April 9th to find out.  Just remember that SYMFONISK isn't due to ship until August -- it's going to be a while before you can judge them for yourself.

By  Peter Kafka    Mar 25, 2019,  4:26pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  We still don’t know what’s in Apple’s streaming service, how much it will cost, or why we should pay for it      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Tim Cook and Oprah Winfrey.  Michael Short/Getty Images     I have some questions about Apple’s new video service:   What, exactly, is Apple going to have in its new video service?  What, if anything, will Apple’s new video service cost?  Why would someone pay anything for Apple’s new video service?   I’ve had these questions for a couple of years, but I figured I would have answers to them today because I just spent two hours watching Tim Cook and other Apple executives show off a new suite of Apple services, with Apple’s video offering as the showstopper.  Nope! Still haven’t found what I’m looking for .  In lieu of answers, Cook and his team did a high-gloss version of hand-waving at their Cupertino, California, HQ today: They brought out Very Big Stars like Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey to tell a worldwide audience that they were indeed working on projects that you might be able to see as soon as this fall. Musician Sara Bareilles played a song on an onstage piano.  Apple did promise that the subscription service would be ad-free and that it would be available in more than 100 countries. And it played the briefest of sizzle reels, which allowed the audience to see that Apple’s production team has indeed shot footage for some of its shows.  But that was it, and that was surprising.  One thing Apple has been very good about is showing off a new piece of hardware or software, telling you why you’d like to use it, and telling you when you can get it. It usually tells you how much it costs, too.  In the absence of any of that information, we have to do some guesswork: Maybe Apple wanted to show off its talent and a vague sense of its plans, because the event isn’t really aimed at consumers who will end up paying for (or at least using) the service. Maybe it was aimed at Wall Street, to convince investors that Apple is really, really serious about using service revenue to augment its slowing hardware sales.  If so, fine. But why not wait until next fall, when Apple’s finally ready to roll out its video offering? That might also be a good time to have talked up Apple’s new gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade, which also had a TBD for pricing and for launch date.  In terms of things Apple is doing right now — or at least very soon — Apple did have some news: Its Apple News+ “Netflix for magazines” service, which also features the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal (as well content from Vox.com , which like Recode is owned by Vox Media) is now available for $10 a month.  And Apple’s overhauled TV app, which is meant to serve as a TV guide and a storefront for subscription services like HBO, Showtime, and Starz, is coming very soon. While Apple didn’t spell it out this way, it hopes this is the thing that will be the core of its video strategy , which also involves distributing its services on hardware owned by competitors like Samsung, Roku, and Amazon, which is a very big shift .  Oh, and there’s a new Apple credit card, which is both virtual and made out of titanium. ( Really .)  Back to the video and the lack of it. Perhaps Apple could have used today to really play up one of its shows, or a handful of them. That’s what the TV guys do at their annual “upfront” presentations, when they try to convince marketers to buy time in upcoming programming based on clips of the stuff that will be out in a few months.  Instead, Apple chose to have giant stars like Spielberg and Winfrey telling us about the shows they were making, not showing us, which violates a basic communications rule. If we didn’t know better, we might think these things aren’t really ready.  And when they are ready, how much is Apple going to charge us to see them? This will be a non-issue if Apple gives them away as inducements to use its main video app, as many industry sources have expected.  But Apple went out of its way to describe what it’s working on as a “subscription service,” which certainly implies a charge. And over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that “people working on the [video] projects said the company plans to charge a fee” for them.  One way to square all of this is to theoretically charge a fee, but bundle the video service with other offerings, which drops the real cost of the service to something very minimal, or less.  That remains the most logical move, since even when Apple does launch its new shows, it is only going to have a handful of new titles to roll out each month. Everyone else charging consumers for video subscriptions — or that plans to — is offering a combination of new things plus an extensive catalog of older shows and movies. HBO, for instance, may sell you on Game of Thrones , but it knows you’ll spend most of your time on the service watching movies like Fast and Furious sequels.  Who knows? Maybe Apple has a genuine surprise up its sleeve and will augment Winfrey, Witherspoon, and Spielberg with a lot of other stuff so you have something to watch when you’re done with the new things.  It’s also possible that this curiously flat show won’t matter at all next fall when the shows are up and running and Apple leverages a huge marketing push — plus its huge installed base of devices — to get people to pony up. But it would be easier to believe that if Apple had more to tell us today.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images     In a startup’s final weeks as a private company, there is a strong incentive to play it safe: no major executive departures, no last-minute strategy shifts, and no billion-dollar acquisitions. Be still, applecart.  Uber isn’t hewing to that conservatism.  The company on Tuesday announced a $3.1 billion deal to buy Careem, Uber’s principal competitor in the Middle East, which is expected to close early next year. The acquisition has leaked out over several months so it’s not a terrific surprise, but that it would announce such a deal so close to the IPO speaks to a way in which possible public market investors should evaluate Uber when they have the chance to buy or short the stock in a few weeks.  To bet on Uber — as is increasingly clear with this Careem purchase — is to bet not on Uber but on a global ride-hailing spoke model in which San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, Inc is merely the hub.  To believe in Uber is to believe in the Uber of the Middle East, Careem, 100 percent of which is now owned by Uber. It is to believe in the Uber of Russia, Yandex, 37 percent of which was owned by Uber. It is to believe in the Uber of Southeast Asia, Grab, 28 percent of which was owned by Uber. And it is to believe in the Uber of China, Didi Chuxing, 20 percent of which was owned by Uber.   Those companies, like Uber, match drivers with riders and take a cut of the booking as revenue.  Not all of these ownership positions reflect Uber’s intentionality or came from a position of strength, for what it’s worth. Its stakes in Yandex, Grab, and Didi came after bleeding billions of dollars in a battle for market share only to sell their overseas operations and retreat back to the United States. Uber has also reportedly had talks to sell its India operation to Ola (you guessed it, the Uber of India).  Uber’s market value — pitched by bankers as high as $120 billion — obviously would not be as high without its valuable stakes in those rival companies. But will those ride-hailing juggernauts fare well as standalone companies when they go public themselves? That’s a question that public market investors will be asking themselves in the next few weeks.  If not, there’s always Lyft — with a limited international footprint, no overseas stakes, and its own IPO later this week.

A scant six months ago, this would have just been the end of the company’s failed attempt to launch its own platform. But in the currently contentious world of PC gaming, it’s a new salvo in the ongoing standoff between Valve’s platform and the upstart Epic Store.  The company appeared to be moving towards its own platform, the Bethesda launcher. But then the calamitous Fallout 76 launch happened, and suddenly that’s not looking like such a great idea — I’m on record saying a lot of the game‘s problems could have been avoided had Bethesda launched it on Steam, and it appears the head honchos have come to the same conclusion.      We’re pleased to announce that RAGE 2, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, and DOOM Eternal will be released on Steam as well as https://t.co/p0BARqmTBp . We will also be bringing Fallout 76 to Steam later this year.  — Bethesda (@bethesda) March 25, 2019    Love tech? You should go to TNW2019  Find out why   See more     In a surprise tweet yesterday, Bethesda announced all of its upcoming games would be on Steam in addition to its Bethesda store, as would the previously-exclusive Fallout 76 . While we don’t yet know if the Bethesda store will launch the games before or alongside Steam, it’s still a tacit admission that the store isn’t up to another major solo launch.  This tweet is also as noteworthy for what it doesn’t say as for what it does — namely, there’s no mention of the games coming to the new Epic Games store. And the fact that Bethesda is throwing its support for Steam is more significant now than it would have been even a few months ago — even if the games come to the Epic Store at some point, Bethesda‘s namedropped Steam first.  The two stores have been engaged in a war of exclusives that’s swiftly dividing the PC gaming market. Every time a new game is announced to be coming to the Epic Store exclusively, the debate over whether it’s good for the consumers reignites. On the one hand, supporters have argued Valve’s monopoly is nothing worth defending, and the revenue split that benefits developers will also trickle down to gamers in the form of cheaper games. On the other hand, critics argue Epic is just dividing the PC gaming market with thought only towards its own profits, and has been known to engage in some shady datamining practices .  Game developers who launch on PC seem to have the option of going for one or the other, and each new name added to each side feels like a point for them. Steam scored not only Bethesda with this tweet, but also the Halo: Master Chief Collection  earlier this month . The Epic Store, meanwhile has been pulling its own share of games, including Obsidian’s promising sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds and the crowdfunded Phoenix Point .  It seems the people at Epic are at least marginally aware they aren’t winning gamers’ hearts and minds. During a talk at the Game Developers Conference last week, Steve Allison, the head of the store, was asked about the company’s move with Metro Exodus . Questioned about the poorly-received move to poach the game from Steam despite extant pre-orders, Allison said “ We don’t want to do that ever again.” Steam, for its part, seems content to wait Epic out rather than change any of its own policies, as it has years of gamer goodwill to bank on.  No matter what, it seems gamers who want to enjoy games on PC are going to be dragged into this conflict whether they like it or not.  TNW Conference 2019 is coming!

Peter Bright - Mar 26, 2019 7:03 pm UTC         Enlarge Valentina Palladino     reader comments  42  with 34 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Huawei MateBook systems that are running the company's PCManager software included a driver that would let unprivileged users create processes with superuser privileges. The insecure driver was discovered by Microsoft using some of the new monitoring features added to Windows version 1809 that are monitored by the company's Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service.  First things first: Huawei fixed the driver and published the safe version in early January , so if you're using a Huawei system and have either updated everything or removed the built-in applications entirely, you should be good to go.  The interesting part of the story is how Microsoft found the bad driver in the first place .  Microsoft Defender ATP does not rely solely on signature-based endpoint antimalware to detect known threats; it also uses heuristics that look for behavior that appears suspicious, even if no particular malware has been identified. Windows itself notices certain actions taken by software and reports them to the Defender ATP cloud service, and machine learning-based algorithms look for anomalies in these reports.  Enter: The US government  Windows 10 version 1809 included tracing designed to detect DOUBLEPULSAR-type backdoors. DOUBLEPULSAR is one of the many techniques devised by the National Security Agency and subsequently leaked . Subsequent to its publication, it has been used in malicious software .  DOUBLEPULSAR provides a way for a compromised kernel driver to run code in user mode. It works by copying some code into the memory of a privileged process that's already running and then directing the system to execute that code by sending an APC to the process. APCs (""asynchronous procedure calls"") are a way to temporarily direct a thread to stop running the function it's running. Instead, they switch to running a different function; when that different function finishes, the thread resumes the original function from where it left off.  APCs are used internally by the operating system for certain I/O operations: instead of having to wait for the system to read or write a file, Windows has a system whereby the read or write operation can be started without waiting, with an APC used to indicate that the read or write has finished.  This requires a pair of back-to-back operations that the kernel can detect: the allocation of some memory within a running process, followed by the kernel sending the process an APC that references that newly allocated memory. Either operation on its own is of little interest, but the two happening together, with the APC using the memory, is indicative of a DOUBLEPULSAR-style attack. Windows 10 version 1809 included sensors to record these kernel operations that are known to be useful for malware.  When legitimate software and malware are indistinguishable  Further investigation revealed that on this particular occasion, it wasn't malware that was injecting and running code in a user process; it was a Huawei-written driver. Huawei's driver was supposed to act as a kind of watchdog: it monitored a regular user mode service that's part of the PCManager software, and if that service should crash or stop running, the driver would restart it. To perform that restart, the driver injected code into a privileged Windows process and then ran that code using an APC—a technique lifted straight from malware.  Why Huawei chose this approach is not immediately clear, as Windows has as a built-in feature the ability to restart crashed services. There's no need for an external watchdog.  The Huawei driver did make some attempts to ensure that it would only communicate with and restart Huawei's own service, but improper permissions meant that even an unprivileged process could hijack the driver's watchdog facility and use it to start an attacker-controlled process with LocalSystem privileges, giving that process complete access to the local system.  Microsoft's researchers then continued to look at the driver and found that it had another flawed capability: it could map any page of physical memory into a user process, with both read and write permissions. With this, the user process can modify the kernel or anything else, and as such it, too, represents a gaping flaw.  While there is, of course, an element of the sales pitch around Microsoft's public description of what it found and how it found it—it shows that Defender ATP can indeed yield relevant and valuable data—this example does a good job of showing how Microsoft is using the regular Windows 10 updates to boost defense in-depth measures and how cloud-based analytics can provide insights that would otherwise be hard to come by. It also highlights just some of the extraordinarily awful things that hardware vendors do when they're tasked with writing software. When your hardware vendors are opening up big security flaws and copying malware techniques, one wonders if we need protection from the good guys as well as the bad ones.                reader comments  42  with 34 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Kyle Orland - Mar 26, 2019 4:14 pm UTC         Aurich x Getty     reader comments  51  with 32 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      PlayStation 4 owners who like buying downloadable game codes directly from brick-and-mortar stores will soon be out of luck. That's because Sony has confirmed to The Verge that it will stop selling such downloadable codes through physical retailers starting on April 1.  The report confirms a Wario64 tweet from last week , which quoted a GameStop memo saying, ""Sony full game digital downloads will only be available for purchase through the PlayStation marketplace"" after April 1. Days Gone and Mortal Kombat 11 will be the sole full-game exceptions to this policy, according to the memo, though DLC and season passes will still be available for direct purchase. It's currently unclear if Web-based retailers like Amazon will be affected by the decision.  Retail availability of digital game codes was especially useful for players who didn't or couldn't use a credit card on the PlayStation Network storefront. Buying digital codes through a retailer also let customers make use of trade-in credit from used physical games and take advantage of other retailer promotions without requiring the purchase of a physical disc.  While individual game codes will no longer be available, brick-and-mortar customers will still be able to buy prepaid PSN currency cards in a newly expanded set of denominations: $10, $20, $50, $75, and $100. That will come off as a little sterile for customers who want to buy someone a downloadable PSN game as a gift, but it will serve the same purpose for most other users.  A PlayStation spokesperson told The Verge that the decision ""was made in order to continue to align key businesses globally,"" whatever that means. Nintendo, Microsoft, and many PC game makers continue to sell digital game codes for specific games directly at retail.  Further Reading Report: Amazon will publish toy catalog this holiday to fill Toys ‘R Us void Sony's move comes during challenging times for game retailers. Physical sales and profits are down throughout the brick-and-mortar marketplace, and Gamestop stock cratered 27 percent in January after the company failed to find a buyer for its thousands of worldwide storefronts. And Toys R Us, one of the country's biggest physical game retailers, shut down after declaring bankruptcy last year .                reader comments  51  with 32 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Kyle Orland Kyle is the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica, specializing in video game hardware and software.

The Galaxy A70 packs a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED 20:9 1,080 x 2,400 display with an ""Infinity-U"" notch. That houses the 32-megapixel, f/2.0 selfie camera that beats the main camera on many other phones. On the back is a 32-megapixel F1.7 main camera (trumping the 24-megapixel main camera on the last model ), an ultra-wide-angle camera and a depth sensor.            With a large 4,500 mAh battery, the Galaxy A70 supports 25W fast charging, making it the first Galaxy phone to do that (the Galaxy S10 5G will also support 25W charging when it arrives in April). As for other specs, it packs an 8-core processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM (depending on the options and region), and 128GB of internal storage on top of a microSD slot that bumps it by 512GB. You'll also get both facial recognition and an in-screen fingerprint reader. The only thing missing is maybe a zoom lens like the kind you can find on Huawei's $400 P20 phone. Still, these are very interesting specs for a mid-range device, and Samsung is likely hoping to drum up some business in that market, given how much the demand for high-end phones has dropped . Samsung has yet to reveal the A70's price and availability, but will reveal more on April 10th.

The announcement is a conclusion of sorts to years-long hype over the tantalizing possibility that the fountain of youth can be found in the bodies of other people.  To find out why that’s not exactly the case, we spoke to Irina Conboy and Michael Conboy , a husband-and-wife research team at UC Berkeley. Back in 2005, the Conboys published one of the landmark papers that kicked off this hype — but the research wasn’t looking at blood transfusions and it wasn’t exactly done in humans. That didn’t stop companies like Ambrosia Health from promising that a couple liters of blood (at $8,000 a pop) would reverse aging, even though the procedure was more likely to put people in danger.  The latest Verge Science video covers this odd story, which is about real science, overgeneralized results, lots of high hopes, and people trying to make a quick buck.

Story by  David Canellis       87  Shares                It’s a challenge to navigate the cryptocurrency space. The entire community pretty much resides within the confines of the Twitter hellscape , where differences in investment portfolios often lead to in-fighting and disinformation.  This is why one ingenious software developer created a new browser extension to help the general public figure out exactly what’s going on. It’s called ‘Coinflict of Interest.’     It’s a simple add-on that presents estimates of an author’s bias towards four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash.  Hmm… The idea is that the composition of someone’s Twitter following could be an indicator of their digital currency preference. If someone regularly interacts with a certain community, they could be filtering information to make it suitable for that particular audience, and thus arises the conflict of interest.  This risk is compounded within the blockchain industry, as the line between cryptocurrency pundit and venture capitalist is often blurred.  Is it always advisable to blindly trust information provided by someone who might be heavily invested in that particular technology? This is the question Coinflict of Interest is trying to help answer.  This one checks out  While this is totally cool (and sometimes hilarious), its usefulness boils down to how reliable these bias ratings really are.  “It’s just a proof-of-concept at this point, really,” creator Luke Childs told Hard Fork. “The results shouldn’t be taken too seriously. I think, in general, the results are accurate enough to be helpful. But there are quite a few anomalies and there’s plenty of room for improvement.”  Coinflict of Interest relies on another cryptocurrency project, hive.one , for community data. It’s a service that ranks the cryptocurrency crowd on their Twitter influence by measuring the amount of attention generated by tweets.  If a ton of Bitcoiners regularly interact with someone’s posts, hive.one considers that person to hold influence over those users.  Adam Back is the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, a software firm focusing on Bitcoin-related projects , so it’s not crazy to assume Bitcoin fans regularly like, retweet and write comments about the things he says.  This one makes sense, too “I’m doing some post-processing on that data, running it through a simple algorithm to try and deduce bias from influence,” explained Childs, who then confirmed there’s currently not enough context available for the ratings to be totally accurate.  “There would need to be some sort of sentiment analysis of users tweet content to work out if they are engaging in a positive or negative manner. I would expect that to drastically improve the results,” he added.  A really neat feature of the extension is the way it shows potential biases even in the little pop-ups that appear when hovering over the profile picture of a particular user. It makes figuring out the context of a certain tweet that much simpler.  Always suspected Yessi was a big-blocker… Coinflict of Interest’s use of hive.one unfortunately means it can’t provide a reading on everyone. It can only give feedback on users featured in its borrowed influencer lists (but, you can actually sign yourself up, so no worries).  For those still keen to try it, Chrome users can grab the extension here . Firefoxers can download it here .  Even users too paranoid to simply install any add-on featured in an article on the internet are catered for (even though this one is open-source). They can build and load it directly into their browser by themselves, and instructions for how to do that are here.

In a press conference held that same afternoon, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added that “[i]t may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy.” But perhaps what was most striking about Powell’s characterization of the problems and persistence of low inflation outlined during those remarks was his statement that low inflation is “one of the major challenges of our time.”  While persistent inflation under 2% is a relatively new phenomenon—having only begun in the aftermath of the Great Recession—it’s not just an issue for Federal Reserve policymakers. For economic agents such as businesses, laborers, savers, and investors, persistently low inflation is also problematic because it brings with it a number of potential consequences that influence economic well-being.    First, low inflation may be symptomatic of a slowdown in the economy—a question both financial markets and policymakers struggle with when assessing whether or not a recession is forthcoming. In turn, an economic slowdown can bring with it slower job growth or a rise in the unemployment rate.  Second, low inflation can limit the effectiveness of monetary policy. Historically, when the economy is weak or in a recession, the Federal Reserve may reduce the federal funds rate to try to stimulate the economy. Recent examples include the Federal Reserve lowering the federal funds rate in response to the 2001 recession and the September 11 terrorist attacks. Using zero as a lower bound for interest rates, if inflation is low then the Federal Reserve is limited in how far it can drop rates. As a result, expansionary monetary policy may require more nontraditional tools—such as quantitative easing—to stimulate the economy. And while these nontraditional tools may be effective, policymakers have considerably less experience in their use.   Third, low inflation can be harmful to banks. Banks make income, in part, by the interest rate spread—the difference between the rates they pay to acquire funds (deposits, for example) and the rate they charge on loans. Banks pay relatively low interest rates on deposits, all the while charging significantly higher interest rates on loans. With low inflation that spread shrinks which can negatively impact bank profitability. A healthy and profitable banking system is important to the economy as banks move funds from savers and investors to borrowers (such as homebuyers and businesses). This process, called financial intermediation, is important to the health and well-being of not only financial markets, but the growth of the economy as a whole.  Finally, if inflation becomes negative—then it’s deflation. Persistent deflation causes a whole host of economic problems as consumers reduce spending, businesses cut back on output, unemployment rises, and investors see a decline in the value of their real and financial assets. While rare historically (the last time was during the Great Depression), persistent deflation increases the likelihood of a severe recession.    To make matters worse, part of the problem of low inflation is that traditional economics and economic policy, for decades concerned with high inflation, have until recently given too little attention to the issue of low inflation. This is not surprising: During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, for instance, the U.S. economy experienced inflation rates over 10%. As a result, policymakers and economic researchers focused on how to quickly bring such high inflation rates down rather than the possibility that inflation could become too low.  Powell was correct when he characterized persistently low inflation as one of the most challenging economic issues of our time. In part, understanding the problems caused by low inflation helps address the other challenges Powell highlighted, such as sustaining the U.S.’s economic expansion. Now, economic research and policy must continue to evolve and find the most effective ways to address those problems.  Kevin Jacques is the Boynton D.

Getty/Michael Short/Stringer             Apple Card , Apple's new credit card, is going to appeal to a lot of users because it promises no fees, better security, and 2% cash back on most purchases, paid out to users daily. It's another new business line for Apple as it looks for ways to generate more revenue from each of its users. Consider also that it's a move that protects against iPhone users switching to Android : It's enough of a pain to ditch iMessage and its blue bubbles; can you imagine having to cancel your credit card, too? Conversely, Apple is offering a higher cash-back rate of 3% on purchases directly from the company, including iCloud, Apple Music, the App Store, and even new iPhones and Macs — giving a strong incentive for users to stick around. In a lot of ways, Apple is the new Microsoft: Where Windows once informed every single decision made by Microsoft, so too does Apple make protecting its flattening iPhone business its first priority. Take, for example, Apple's much-vaunted push into services, which took center stage at an event on its Apple Park campus on Monday morning . New services such as Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and Apple TV Plus are all slated to run first, and best, on iPhones and Macs, helping the company squeeze more revenue from every Apple user in the world. And then, there's Apple Card , the new credit card offered in conjunction with Goldman Sachs that's designed to work with Apple Pay. Apart from the obvious profits it stands to make from just getting into the credit-card business, the launch of this card is an intriguing move that hints at how Apple views the state of the smartphone business. If you're feeling charitable, you could reasonably make the argument that Apple is just doing what it always does: taking something that already exists and making it better. Credit cards, generally speaking, are pretty bad; Apple's no-fee, instant-rewards, security-focused alternative seems to be at least a little more humane — on paper, anyway. Read more : Apple's new Apple Card credit card doesn't have any hidden fees or late-payment charges The other way of looking at it is that this is a shrewd business move for Apple. Not only does the company get a toehold in the lucrative financial-services market, but it also makes it that much less appealing to switch from an iPhone to Android. It's one thing to lose the vaunted blue text bubbles that come with Apple's iMessage, but can you imagine having to cancel your credit card just because you bought a new phone? What Apple gets The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Anecdotally, at least some people seem really excited about the prospect of the Apple Card. It's likely to see considerable uptake, too, given that Apple is likely to heavily promote it to iPhone users once it's available later this year. At the same time, it's worth really considering what Apple gets out all of this. Note that while Apple Card promises 2% cash-back rewards on most purchases , paid out to users on a daily basis, that goes up to 3% for purchases made directly from Apple itself. That means a blanket discount for Apple iCloud, Apple Music, App Store purchases, or even a new Mac or iPhone. So if the hassle of switching is the stick, that amped-up cash-back reward is the carrot. Taken together, they form a very clear picture: With Apple Card, you get rewarded for diving deeper into Apple's whole ecosystem of products and services, and the card simultaneously makes it that much harder to leave. That's important in a world where it gets harder to justify paying the rising price of an iPhone , as midrange Android phones look to be just fine for most people. Apple Card's Daily Cash feature pays out 2% cash-back bonuses on most purchases and 3% rewards on anything bought from Apple. Apple It's not completely dissimilar from what Facebook is doing amid Mark Zuckerberg's grand pivot to private messaging among small groups. By focusing on direct messages and commerce, Facebook is slowly positioning itself as the middleman between you and the real world — across both your social life and your daily spending habits. In so doing, it makes it way more convenient to use Facebook and, therefore, that much harder to stop using it, which is a real concern for the social network in a post-Cambridge Analytica world. Read more : Mark Zuckerberg's vision for Facebook sounds a lot like China, where I couldn't buy a cup of coffee without the app that dominates people's lives there In any case, the Apple Card may be a good and worthwhile opportunity for anybody who finds its benefits appealing. But consider that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch — no matter how much cash you get back from your daily sandwich run — and that this convenience has the hidden cost of giving Apple more power over your digital life.

Certain sectors outperform in this environment. Three months after the inversion, insurance and industrial stocks tend to do the best, while defensive stocks tend to outperform 12 months after.      Kate Rooney | @Kr00ney   Published 5 Hours Ago  Updated  1 Hour Ago  CNBC.com              Spencer Platt | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City.   The bond market is flashing a recession warning. But certain stock sectors may still hold up.   On Friday, the U.S. yield curve "" inverted "" — meaning the yield on the 3-month Treasury rose above the yield on the 10-year note. Historically, this means a recession is on the horizon.  The last seven times the yield curve inverted, excluding a 2-week inversion in 1998, the U.S. economy went into recession every single time within 15 months, according to data from Credit Suisse.   ""Historically investors have often tried to come up with reasons for why things are different this time around and have often been proven wrong,"" Credit Suisse research analyst Andrew Garthwaite said in a note to clients Tuesday.  Stocks may still have a bit more room to run until they take a hit. Six months after the yield curve inverts is typically when stocks peak, Garthwaite said. During the three months after an inversion, the S&P 500 rose by an average 4 percent, and was up 75 percent of the time. But on a longer time horizon — 18 months out — the S&P was down an average 8 percent, and up only 38 percent of the time.  Still, certain sectors do better than others in that environment. In the first three months after the inversion, insurance and industrial stocks show the strongest median out-performance. Semiconductors and consumer durables are historically the biggest laggards.  One year after the yield curve inverts, though, there's a more definite split. Defensive stocks like healthcare equipment, pharmaceuticals and insurance historically outperform in the 12 months after the yield curve inverts. A defensive stock is something that has constant demand for products and isn't typically correlated to the rest of the business cycle. They tend to kick back a consistent dividend and relatively stable earnings regardless of stock market conditions.  More ""cyclical"" stocks, which do rely on market conditions, tend to underperform, according to Credit Suisse. Autos and technology hardware are among the laggards 12 months after the yield curve inverts.

Siemens             Barbara Humpton became CEO of Siemens USA last year, after a decade of executive positions. She was long told she did not ""fit the mold"" of being an executive. She learned that there is no correct way to be a leader, as long as you utilize your strengths to drive results. C-Suite Insider is a collection of exclusive interviews with leaders of the world's largest companies. ""I had leaders communicate to me all the time in my mid-career, 'Hey, Barb, we really like you and you make great contributions — you're just not executive material,'"" Siemens USA CEO Barbara Humpton told Business Insider . Humpton became CEO of the German engineering conglomerate's American branch last June, after a decade of executive roles at various corporations. She credits her career success to recognizing that the whole idea of ""executive material"" was a lie. ""I had this core feeling in my heart that wait, business needs more of what I'm bringing to the table,"" she said. She's naturally an optimist, she said, and is energetic and enthusiastic. The bias was also linked to overt sexism: As she told Time last year, a leader at IBM once said in 1990 that she had to choose between being a mother or being an executive. But even if someone had the best intentions with their advice, the prevailing wisdom of the day was that Humpton would have to be more stern and suppress part of her personality. ""In the first 20 years of my career, management theory at the time was they wanted to teach us how to correct our deficiencies. 'We want to teach you how to be the leader that you need to be and so we're going to send you to school,' and I wasn't one to fit the mold."" The mold certainly didn't equate with good leadership. As business consultant Marcus Buckingham noted in his best-selling management guide from 1999, "" First, Break All the Rules ,"" the best leaders foster strengths rather than try to correct weaknesses and end up with a team of similarly well-rounded individuals. Humpton saw ""executive material"" equated with management through ""fear and intimidation,"" but knew that her proclivity for ""engagement and inspiration"" would lend themselves to leadership. ""Looking at my leadership team today here in the US, what I love about this team, we all have different styles, but we all get stuff done,"" she said. It's important that they share goals, like a commitment to creating long-term value and developing their workforce, she said — but the only aspect of their leadership style that matters is that it works for their particular team. (And if someone has more of that old-school, heavy-handed approach to leadership and it works for that person's team, then that's great, she said.) ""Something fundamental that I've learned over these last few years, is that, first of all you're going to be most effective when you're your authentic self,"" Humpton said. ""The best thing possible is if you can get yourself into a job that aligns well with your natural capabilities — and this one does.""  This is a subscriber-only story.

THE COMBATANTS are world famous, with legions of supporters. The venue, on April 19th, is Toronto’s Sony Centre, which seats over 3,000 people. Tickets sell on eBay for more than $300. But it is not a boxing match or a rap battle—it is a debate between a Lacanian psychoanalyst and a Jungian clinical psychologist. The theme? What produces more happiness, Marxism or capitalism? The debaters have become popular and subversive figures in recent years within their ideological subcultures. Slavoj Zizek, the Lacanian (who is Slovenian), has spent decades frequenting the opinion pages of newspapers and the left-wing corners of YouTube with his Marxist critiques of popular culture. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Jordan Peterson, the Jungian (who is Canadian), shot to fame in 2016 with a viral YouTube video of him lecturing on why he refused to address students by their preferred gender pronouns. (Spoiler alert: his freedom of speech trumped their interest to be referred to in a specific way, he argued.) He’s since been a galvanising hero to right-leaning young men, with his politically incorrect YouTube videos, outspoken television appearances and a best-selling self-help book called “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos”. The media relishes referring to Mr Zizek as “the most dangerous philosopher in the West”. Mr Peterson has been put forward as “the most influential public intellectual in the Western world” in no less than the pages of the New York Times . Both are known to shock first and ask questions later, a habit that rarely goes unrewarded in an algorithmic public sphere that buries nuance under controversy. Both men have made their way into The Economist ’s Open Future coverage too. Last May Mr Peterson couldn’t name a single feminist he admired, in a podcast interview . Meanwhile Mr Zizek stated in an interview in October that “populism is simply a new way to imagine capitalism without its harder edges”. The debate matters because liberal values that were once widely accepted are now discredited in the eyes of millions of young people who feel stung by economic inequality, excluded by a distant elite or fear that diversity happens at their expense. Messrs Peterson and Zizek are eyeing up the intellectual territory in the vacuum left behind. The ideas which flourish now could define the next era of political ideology. Liberal values that were once widely accepted are now discredited in the eyes of millions of young people Their disagreement emerged early last year when Mr Zizek wrote an op-ed entitled “Why do people find Jordan Peterson so convincing? Because the left doesn’t have its own house in order.” Mr Zizek argued that Mr Peterson’s popularity proved that the right needed to exaggerate the threat to freedom of speech from the politically-correct left in order to hide the inconsistencies and inadequacies of its own ideology. Mr Peterson challenged him on Twitter to debate, and the philosopher-fight was on. The two thinkers have many ideas in common. Both Mr Peterson and Mr Zizek agree that the modern left’s preoccupation with identity politics and political correctness has alienated it among the working class. Both agree that political correctness has gone too far. But Mr Zizek believes that an exaggerated focus on freedom of speech on university campuses exposes a weakness in conservative thought: that it is a worldview that can only be sustained by stoking fears that society is being undermined by malign forces. It will be fascinating to see how Mr Peterson responds. His most dedicated readers are probably surprised that the debate is on happiness, since Mr Peterson has repeatedly challenged those who promote happiness as a priority.  In his book, “12 Rules for Life”, he writes: “If happiness is the purpose of life, what happens when you’re unhappy? Then you’re a failure. And perhaps a suicidal failure. Happiness is like cotton candy. It’s just not going to do the job.” Mr Zizek, for his part, has been equally critical of the search for serotonin. In 2014 he told the Guardian newspaper that “Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don’t know what we really want.” He concluded: “Happiness is a category of slaves”. “Happiness is like cotton candy. It’s just not going to do the job.” The vague nature of the debate raises questions about its intellectual significance. After all, it involves two pop-star pundits with a penchant for self-promotion. The debate could have been held for free and in public at almost any university in the world. Still others are surprised the event is even happening. Douglas Lain, the publisher of Zero Books, a left-wing imprint, believes that by putting Mr Zizek on an equal footing, Mr Peterson lends credibility to Marxist ideas. “The left worries about legitimising people like Peterson, but in the current moment I think Peterson is in the position to grant some leftists popular legitimacy,” says Mr Lain. “Zizek wins simply by appearing on stage with Peterson.” That is likely to make Mr Zizek smile, even if he does not think happiness is all that important. As for who will win, that is hard to predict. Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, the opposite is true.

Ethiopian Airlines said Monday it would maintain ties with the U.S. plane maker.      Emma Newburger | @emma_newburger   Published 1 Hour Ago  Updated  1 Hour Ago  CNBC.com              Stephen Brashear | Getty Images A Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliner takes off from Renton Municipal Airport near the company's factory, on March 22, 2019 in Renton, Washington. After two crashes of 737 MAX planes in five months, the model has been grounded from from passenger flights by aviation authorities throughout the world.   Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the aircraft maker was ""humbled and learning"" from an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people earlier this month, the second fatal crash of its popular 737 Max plane in less than 5 months.   ""We've stood shoulder to shoulder in partnership with the Ethiopian team to grieve and extend our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and communities of the passengers and crew,"" Muilenburg wrote in a statement released Monday.  Ethiopian Airlines said on Monday it would maintain ties with the U.S. plane maker despite questions and an investigation into its 737 Max 8 model, which was also involved in the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people in October.   Boeing is under intense scrutiny as federal investigators look into whether the plane maker provided incomplete or misleading information about the model to U.S. air-safety regulators.  Read Muilenburg's full statement below.  As the lead engineer on a project earlier in my career, I watched my pilot friend climb into the cockpit of a prototype aircraft and fly it for the first time. He landed safely, and I exhaled with admiration and relief—a vivid memory I carry with me every day. Knowing someone's life depends on your work is an unforgettable feeling, and it's one shared among all of us at Boeing. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of safety, excellence and integrity in our work because the stakes could not be higher. Since the moment we learned of the recent 737 MAX accidents, we've thought about the lives lost and the impact it has on people around the globe and throughout the aerospace community. All those involved have had to deal with unimaginable pain. We're humbled by their resilience and inspired by their courage. In the weeks since the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accident, the airline's crews have demonstrated this by continuing to serve the flying public with distinction and professionalism. As the airline's Group CEO Ato Tewolde GebreMariam said in his heartfelt statement yesterday, this tragedy does not define Ethiopian—and it won't define the aviation industry or our enduring relationship with their team. For those of us who have worked with them over the years, this comes as no surprise. Ethiopian Airlines has a proud history that stretches more than seven decades. In that time, Ethiopian has been a pioneer and a leader in our industry, launching Africa into the jet age, connecting the continent with all corners of the globe with its extensive network, and earning a reputation for service and safety. More than just an airline, Ethiopian represents the pride and progress of a great people and a symbol of The New Spirit of Africa. We are all humbled and learning from this experience. We've stood shoulder to shoulder in partnership with the Ethiopian team to grieve and extend our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and communities of the passengers and crew. With a shared value of safety, be assured that we are bringing all of the resources of The Boeing Company to bear, working together tirelessly to understand what happened and do everything possible to ensure it doesn't happen again. All of us thank Ethiopian Airlines for their commitment and share their resolve to doing everything possible to build an even safer air travel system. Boeing stands together with all our customers and partners to earn and strengthen the flying public's trust and confidence in us every day.

The film raked in more than $70 million over the weekend , well past double the opening weekend receipts of Peele’s first film, Get Out, and exceeding the expectations of industry insiders. (Unsurprised Peele fans simply sipped their tea and nodded.) I won’t spoil much of it here except to say that its central metaphor is a powerful one made for modern times: Every American has a double who looks exactly like them, abandoned in an empty subterranean world, who rises up to fight for their freedom and their due.  With that image in mind, I’m going to switch back to the real world and point out that some of us are feeling pretty abandoned right now.  First, there’s Puerto Rico .  Congress expanded food stamp aid to the island after the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. But the federal government missed the deadline to renew that aid earlier this month. And, it seems, lawmakers have been getting strong signals from the administration that no new aid will be coming. Some 43 percent of island residents are now struggling to buy food and other essentials, the island is still owed billions in yet undispersed emergency funds, and residents are now facing cuts to Medicaid. Each of these remedies requires the support of the federal government, which is unlikely to come. “[The President] doesn’t want another single dollar going to the island,” a senior official told The Washington Post.  Then, there’s Pine Ridge.  Recent snow, rain, and related flooding have set off a natural disaster on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, which is not looking to clear up any time soon.  Some residents have been stranded as long as two weeks; washed out roads have made it nearly impossible for food, medical, and other supplies to reach them. Volunteers on horseback are delivering essentials when they can, but increasingly, ill, elderly or otherwise desperate residents have been braving the weather and walking for miles to get help.  From the New York Times :    Officials with the Oglala Sioux Tribe, which administers the reservation, say they lack the training, manpower and equipment needed to deal with such a large-scale crisis. And there’s a pervasive sense on Pine Ridge, a place of long-strained relations with the state and federal governments, that help has been woefully slow to arrive, and that few people beyond the reservation know or care much about its plight.    And finally, there are the Muslims next door.  This past Sunday, a mosque in Southern California was set on fire in an attack which was designed to express solidarity with the perpetrator in the March 15 attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The arsonist used an accelerant to fuel the fire set to the Dar-ul-Arqam mosque in Escondido, a city near San Diego, Calif. and left graffiti referencing the New Zealand attack. Thankfully, nobody was killed or injured.  But it sent a message. Hate crimes and other bias-related incidents against U.S. Muslims have ticked-up dramatically in the last few years. According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations , there were 2,213 incidents of anti-Muslim bias in 2016, 260 of which were verified hate crimes. In 2017, 2,599 incidents of bias, including workplace discrimination, of which 300 were hate crimes. This is the highest number since 2009, the year CAIR began keeping track.  Jordan Peele’s latest film examines the deep divisions that stem from our shared history, and the struggle of people who have been cast away in a failed experiment of exploitation. But it doesn’t take a film critic to see how many times these scenes play out in real life, with real people who play the other in our policies, while in fact, they are us.          On Point               Charges dropped against actor Jussie Smollett    Prosecutors have dropped all charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett today, barely a month after he was charged with 16 counts including disorderly conduct and filing a false police report. There are few details, but there is no plea agreement and no community service will be required.     ABC News      Study: Public colleges recruit from white, wealthy communities    As we continue to unpack the ramifications of the recent college admissions scandal, it’s worth remembering the many legal ways wealthy families game the system. And, it looks like they get a lot of help. A new report from the Joyce Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that funds policies to advance racial and economic equity in the Midwest, finds that when public colleges recruit out-of-state students, they do so disproportionately from white, wealthy, and often private high schools. The resulting student body doesn’t reflect the population of the states they serve. Perhaps then, “the enrollment priorities of some public research universities are biased against poor students and/or communities of color.”     Inside Higher Ed      A new startup aims to help people fight for their rights in toxic workplaces    After being pushed out of jobs at male-dominated startups, Ariella Steinhorn and Mary Rinaldi joined forces to start Simone, an early stage NY-based startup that helps match people who had been dealing with toxic work environments, or potential discrimination or #MeToo claims with affordable legal and other advice. The company is still a team of two, but they believe they’re on to something. “It gave me all the legwork… I wouldn’t know where to go, and I don’t think this is something you can Google,” said one woman who used Simone to file an EEOC complaint.     Fortune      Deaf activist, actor, and transgender man cast as in DC’s Titans    It’s a milestone in casting says Chella Man, who has been tapped to play the role of mute superhero Jericho in the streaming “Titans” series, which is slated for a second season.  Jericho signs to communicate with his superhero squad. “Jericho’s primary mode of communication hits close to home,” Man told Huffpost via email. “I rarely saw sign language authentically represented on screen growing up, so this incredible opportunity has made my heart soar.” Some 95% of characters with disabilities are played by actors without any. Not that Man feels that any of his own characteristics are limiting, mind you. “Take it from a Deaf, queer, Jewish person of color who has always dreamed of being a superhero and has now been granted that exact opportunity,” he said.     Huffpost         Advertisement        On Background               Take the mic, please. No, really, take it    Professional people live in a world of meetings and conferences, and along with it, the tap-tap-tap of the passed microphone for questions and answers. Is this thing on? Take the mic, says Jessie B. Ramey, an associate professor, and director of the Women’s Institute at Chatham University. When you do that, “naw I’m good,” and belt out your comment, you’re forgetting the hard of hearing colleagues in the room. “When you say you don’t need a microphone, what you’re really saying is that you don’t care that I need you to use one,” she points out. “And that those with hearing loss will speak up for themselves — whether it’s comfortable to do so or not, and no matter how many times we have already had to do that in these same meetings.” Click through for more essential microphone-related inclusion tips.     Chronicle of Higher Education      In praise of Bibaporru, Beep Vaporú, El Bic, El Bix, El Vickisito    Vicks Vaporub, the greasy, odiferous goo that has been a staple in medicine chests for a century, holds an unusually beloved place in many Latinx communities, reports Esmerelda Bermudez. True believers use it for absolutely everything – from handling cuts and stretch marks, to adding a distinct flavor to coffee and tea. “Latinos have created vivaporu  hashtags , memes , emojis , comedy skits and, for those still scratching their heads at the love affair, explanatory videos ,” she say. “Some have written about their nostalgia in dissertations, poems and published essays.” But the simple answer may in fact be the smell. Says one cognitive neuroscientist, the smell may evoke feelings associated with love, of “not of feeling sick, but of being cared for and being soothed.”     Deloitte      Doing the laundry was a nasty bit of business in 1881    In a busy city like Atlanta, black “washerwomen” would pick up dirty clothes and diapers, pile them on their heads and travel to washing sites equipped with cauldrons of boiling water and homemade lye soap. they, they would boil, pound, dry, iron and return the clothes. All, for nearly no money – until one day, the women had enough. The day just happened to fall ahead of the International Cotton Exposition which was being held in the city that year, the centerpiece of which was a boast: Atlanta had a steady and obedient servant class. Because washerwomen lived in black communities and worked together, not in a white home, they could organize. And they sure did: Some 3,000 women went on strike.     Atlanta Journal-Constitution           Quote                Dear Joel: I think it is more difficult these days to define what makes a good citizen then it has ever been before. Certainly all any of us can do is follow our own conscience and retain faith in our democracy. Sometimes it is the very people who cry out the loudest in favor of getting back to what they call ‘American Virtues’ who lack this faith in our country. I believe that our greatest strength lies always in the protection of our smallest minorities. Sincerely yours, Charles M. Schulz.   - —Charles Schultz in a letter to ten-year-old fan, Joel Lipton                   SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT        You May Like                   Read More      Sign Up for Our Newsletters  Sign up now to receive FORTUNE's best content, special offers, and much more.

Timing is everything, especially in a housing market that has been less than dependable lately. So if you want to get the best price for your home in the shortest amount of time, you'd better list it next week, at least according to realtor.com.   Homes listed in the first week of April get 14 percent more online views on average and are likely to sell six days faster than the average during the rest of the year.  Homes sold in April are also priced 6 percent higher than those in January. According to the most recent pricing data, that could mean an additional $17,000 for sellers listing the typical home prices around $306,000. One caveat is that realtor.com is looking at average prices and does not take into account the type of homes for sale at different times of year. Larger, more expensive homes tend to be listed in the spring because families like to move over the summer, during school vacations.   ""Given the time it takes from listing to close, putting a home on the market in early April positions sellers to attract buyers seeking to close and move before the beginning of school year,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com.  The number of buyers jumps dramatically in April, but the number of listings doesn't peak until a little later, so there is less seller competition. The average list price in June is higher than April, again as larger family homes are being listed during school vacations, but there are fewer buyers, which increases the chance for a price reduction, although not by much. Homes listed in June are 1 percent more likely to see a price reduction and garner 2 percent fewer online views on average than the rest of the year.  If next week was already a great week to list, the steep drop in mortgage rates that started last week is only making it better. Buyers now have a little bit more purchasing power. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen more than a quarter of a percentage point in the last week and is nearly a full point lower than the recent peak last November. Every quarter-point drop knocks about $50 off the monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage.  Of course all real estate is local, and locality can impact timing. The best time to list in New York, Chicago and Dallas is March 31, according to realtor.com. In Atlanta and Seattle, it's April 7. In Los Angeles and Boston, it's April 14. In Phoenix and Tampa, it's early June.  And not everyone agrees. Researchers at Zillow, a competitor of realtor.com, claim the first two weeks in May are the best nationally. They add that homes listed on Saturdays get the most page views, although most real estate agents will tell you Thursday is when most people are trolling online, planning their weekend house hunts.  ""Sellers time their listings to optimize their sale in all sorts of ways,"" said Skylar Olsen, Zillow's director of economic research and outreach. ""Some need to time the sale just right to manage their own synchronized home purchase. Others are seeking to get the highest sale price possible.""

Soon addicted, Mr Lin—not his real name—spent many of the subsequent years behind bars, including several long stretches in detention centres for drug users. He says wardens in these “compulsory isolation detoxification” facilities put him to work in prison factories. Such places are meant to heal your body, he says (inmates are pictured exercising). But they “damage your soul”. China is tough on drugs. Many traffickers are among the thousands of people executed annually. Sometimes they are paraded beforehand at public sentencing rallies. Attendees at these grim spectacles include busloads of schoolchildren. Drug users may be punished on the spot by police. Many are locked up in centres like the ones where Mr Lin was sent, often for stretches of two to three years without trial. In 2017 about 320,000 people spent time in such camps, says China’s anti-narcotics agency. That is about 36,000 fewer than in 2016 but about 120,000 more than in 2012. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. After their release from these facilities, former inmates still suffer harassment by the police. Mr Lin’s latest incarceration (for two years) ended in 2018. He is sober, thoughtful and keen not to fall back into addiction. But his name is still on the government’s list of drug users. Such people are liable to be given random urine tests by police. Often these are conducted at police stations. Sometimes they are sprung on people when they check into hotels or try to board planes. Mr Lin speculates that smart security cameras and mobile-phone tracking can make it easier for police to find and test people whenever they please. Last month President Donald Trump said he had asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, whether China had a drug problem. He said Mr Xi denied it. “We give death penalty to people who sell drugs. End of problem,” Mr Trump quoted Mr Xi as saying, as if in stilted English. Yet China clearly does have a problem. The number of registered drug users (supposedly not including those who have been clean for more than three years) has been drifting steadily upwards. In 1991 there were 150,000 such people. By 2017 there were 2.5m. Experts estimate that the total number of addicts is around five times higher. Until a few years ago China’s main problem with hard drugs involved heroin use in poor provinces such as Yunnan that lie closest to the foreign poppy-fields of South-East Asia. These days, however, use of hard drugs is more evenly spread across China. It more commonly involves synthetic stimulants, chiefly methamphetamine. The drugs are still mostly smuggled in, usually from Myanmar. Some are cooked up in illegal Chinese laboratories. Worried by these trends, the authorities have been experimenting with less punitive methods of controlling the demand side. The management of China’s compulsory detoxification centres has mostly passed from the police to the judiciary. The latter is slightly more interested in providing inmates with appropriate medical help, says one Chinese expert. The police, meanwhile, no longer pack drug users off to such places on their first offence (though they remain vigilant: in January police in Beijing put up notices offering a reward of 500 yuan—about $75—for information leading to each arrest of a drug user, or 20,000 yuan for a group of ten or more). Wang Weijia of Glimmer of Hope, a charity that provides advice to drug users and their families, says that the provision of addiction treatment at private hospitals and clinics has grown in recent years. The number of clinics in China that are licensed to offer methadone treatment to heroin addicts (methadone does not work for those addicted to synthetic stimulants) increased from a handful in 2004 to more than 700 in 2013. Most of them are state-owned. To be eligible to receive methadone addicts must prove that they have undergone detox treatment, whether in the compulsory camps or at clinics. But change is slow. People who go to methadone clinics or private treatment centres risk being pounced on by police trying to meet arrest quotas. A law passed in 2008 promised more “community-based” rehabilitation programmes. But there are still few of them and they are not very effective. There is still no convincing sign that the government is trying to create an alternative to detention. Officials are reasonably good at spotting heroin users, whose lives are often entirely upturned by their addictions. But according to a paper by two criminologists at American universities, Sheldon Zhang and Ko-Lin Chen, officers find it much trickier to pick out users of methamphetamines and other powerful stimulants, which do not at first create the same all-consuming dependency as heroin. One expert’s guess is that the government’s registry of drug users identifies about one-third of the country’s heroin users but only a little over one-tenth of methamphetamine addicts. Since 2016 several places have tried testing for drug residue in sewage in order to help the police find addicts and traffickers. China’s anti-drug agency said this method had “transformed” anti-narcotics work. In April 2018 the southern city of Zhongshan said the technique had led to the arrests of 341 drug users in the preceding year. Many officials still regard substance abuse as a moral problem rather than a medical one, says Hao Wei of the Chinese Association of Drug-Abuse Prevention and Treatment. Political stigma complicates the issue. In the 19th century China lost two wars against Britain that were triggered by the smuggling of opium into China by British traders. Many Chinese blame Britain for fuelling Chinese addiction to the drug and plunging the country into a “century of humiliation” by foreign powers. Today’s drug users inherit some of that shame. China’s punitive approach to the problem will not help it go away.

But the two-hour show on March 25th put on by Tim Cook, Jobs’s less histrionic successor as boss of Apple, may nevertheless be remembered as a milestone for the company—and the entertainment industry. Mr Cook did not announce the latest sleek gadget. Instead, he unveiled a suite of products and services, including video streaming, news, games and even a credit card. As theatre, it was underwhelming—star-studded supporting cast including Oprah Winfrey notwithstanding. As a business case, it looks more compelling. Apple’s 900m iPhones worldwide, more than six times as many as Netflix has subscribers, grant it access to a massive potential audience. Analysts speculate that Apple will eventually offer them a variant of Amazon Prime, where customers pay a flat monthly fee for some combination of news, games, cloud storage, music and video, and which could possibly connect with the company’s iPhone subscriptions. Mr Cook stopped short of announcing a unique subscription service, promising instead to roll out five separate offerings, some of which are merely older services in nicer packaging. Together, they nevertheless threaten fellow tech giants, Hollywood and banks. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Apple TV+, which got featured billing from Mr Cook, will offer original programming from Ms Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Sesame Street and others in more than 100 countries. The money Apple plans to spend on original shows—perhaps $1bn to $2bn thus far—is dwarfed by that of Netflix, which will splurge as much as $15bn this year on original and licensed content, or Disney, whose own video-streaming is expected shortly. But Apple’s high-profile shows are for now meant chiefly to lure customers into its universe of apps and services. That includes subscription services for games, a catalogue of big American magazines (and a few newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal ), and, in America, pay-TV networks such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. You can pay for it all using your new Apple Card, developed with bankers at Goldman Sachs. The credit card puts Apple in direct competition with banks: it has no fees and will give users 2% cash back on purchases made via Apple Pay, the company’s payments system—or 3% on purchases of Apple kit and services. Although Apple continues to earn most of its money from devices, its business in services is growing quickly, accounting for nearly $40bn of revenues of $266bn in 2018 (see chart). The new subscription offerings, which are easier to click and buy than their predecessors, should accelerate that trend. Its new partners hope to be along for the ride. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that Apple may convert 10% of the 85m monthly users of its free News app into paying subscribers, for instance. Amazon Channels, which Apple TV channels aped, has boosted subscriptions for HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple gets a cut of newspaper and TV subscriptions sold through its services, just as it gets a cut of sales in its app store. Some content providers are leery. The New York Times and Washington Post have spurned Apple’s advances on behalf of its news service. Netflix and Disney will not partake in Apple TV+, which they view as more a threat than an opportunity. They are right to be cautious. The future of media will belong to whoever controls relationships with consumers, industry insiders say. Thanks to its ubiquitous devices, Apple has hundreds of millions of customer relationships. With that comes the power to get more of their time and money, and to cut out competitors. Mr Cook may put on a lacklustre show, but his rivals had better watch him regardless.

To get it delivered daily to your in-box, sign up here .  Zack Van Amburg, an Apple executive for not quite two years, already has mastered the company’s art of aspirational dissembling. Monday morning, he helped announce the technology giant’s yet-to-launch Apple TV Plus subscription product with a show of force and money that included Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. “It’s not just another streaming service,” he declared. He was partly right: Amazon Prime, Netflix , Hulu, HBO Go, and others have apps and pricing plans. So far Apple TV Plus has neither. Other than that, Apple’s looked quite similar.  In fact, Apple unveiled nothing at its big event that others haven’t done before. Its credit card offers cash back . That’s not new. (As I was reading a New York Times review of the day I saw an ad for a Capital One “unlimited 2% cash back” offer.) Apple bought its way into offering oodles of magazines in its subscription Apple News Plus product, though it didn’t mention Texture, the magazine industry joint venture it purchased last year. Apple obviously hasn’t re-invented television; its offerings, while exciting, are top-flight conventional programs bought at auction with the best money that iPhone profits can buy. Apple’s most exciting idea of the day may have been the resuscitation of Oprah’s book club.    The cognoscenti sniffed at Apple’s bid for services greatness. Breakingviews, in a dismissive report titled “Spray and pray,” said Apple is “paving a trail of mediocrity.” Fortune ’s Rick Tetzeli lamented that Apple showed only its power and not its creativity of old. On Wall Street, Apple’s stock fell back 1%, while rival Roku (roku)  jumped ahead 5% .  The critics may be right. It’s also possible they are missing the point. I suspect Apple can in fact buy a seat at the television-production table and then sufficiently feed its eventual TV service. Its news aggregation service, which pays news organizations for their work, is certainly better than what Facebook and Google have been paying. If Apple makes using a credit card brain-dead easier than it already is, I suspect it will succeed there, too.  Greatness is tough to achieve, and Apple (aapl) may not be after it anyway. Reigniting growth is the imperative right now.

For people with good credit scores, Apple's card may offer a low interest rate. While Apple's card won't have any printed numbers on it, increasing security, that's not the most common kind of credit card scam.      Kif Leswing | @kifleswing   Published 1 Hour Ago  Updated  49 Mins Ago  CNBC.com              Bloomberg | Getty Images   Apple announced a new credit card issued in conjunction with Goldman Sachs at a launch event at its campus on Monday. Apple is promoting it as a simpler credit card, with no fees, powerful integration with iPhone spending tools and attractive rewards when customers use Apple Pay, Apple's digital wallet.   But the company glossed over many critical details, including interest rates and who will qualify. In fact, people with bad credit might not even be eligible for Apple Card.  CNBC read through the fine print and asked some experts to weigh in. Here's what you need to know.      High variable APR   Like other credit cards, the Apple Card has a high interest rate for people who carry a balance. Apple said that users will pay an APR between 13.24% and 24.24%, based on individual credit scores.  That's a wider range than most cards have, CreditCards.com industry analyst Ted Rossman said.  For people with great credit scores, Apple could be a good deal.  ""On the low end, meaning people with better credit, Apple's interest rate is significantly lower than the national average,"" which was 17.67% , according to a CreditCards.com survey.  The high-end rate suggests that Apple will make its card widely available, but will significantly raise rates for people with bad credit, Rossman suggested.  ""I think people in the low to mid-600 range will probably quality for the card,"" Rossman said. ""If your score is so low you're probably not going to get any cards at all. But among people who can get cards, I think this card will be pretty widely available.""         show chapters               Apple reveals Apple Card digital credit card   1:42  PM ET Mon, 25 March 2019 |  04:16        An Apple representative declined to comment on a credit score cutoff for Apple Card. Apple said on Monday that its goal is to ""provide interest rates that are among the lowest in the industry"" and that it wanted to make the Apple Card available to the largest number of people possible.     Apple Pay Cash fees   While the Apple Card doesn't have an annual membership fee, there are some fees for certain transactions through its Apple Pay Cash service.  Apple Pay Cash is the service that allows people to send digital money to other iPhone users. It competes directly with PayPal' s Venmo and Square Cash.  The two services are closely linked. Rewards from the Apple Card are paid through the Apple Pay Cash account, for example.  Apple will charge a 1 percent fee to make an instantaneous transfer from an Apple Pay Cash balance to a debit card, maxing out at $10, although direct bank transfers are free. This means that while Apple Card doesn't have fees, some of Apple's associated services might have one.     Fraud prevention           Source: Apple  Titanium Apple Card    Another key selling point of the Apple Card is the iPhone giant's reputation for security. Apple spent significant time on Monday positioning Apple Card as more secure than other credit cards and created a specific web page on the Apple Card site to promote the security and privacy features of the card.  The physical version of the Apple Card is titanium and laser-etched with the user's name -- but it doesn't have any numbers on it, which Apple argues makes it more secure.  The idea is that if your card is physically stolen or someone can take a picture of the front or back, the thief can't use it.  ""Your Apple card is more secure than others, it has no card number, no CVV, no expiration and no signature,"" Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey emphazied on Monday.  The Better Business Bureau tracks credit card scams, and spokesperson Katherine Hutt generally agrees the lack of numbers is a good thing.  ""In a typical scenario, if someone finds your wallet, they go online and buy a large item with your credit card immediately before you cancel,"" Hutt said. ""Without numbers, they can't do it.""  However, Hutt warned, other scenarios are increasingly common, and Apple Card holders shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security.  ""Scammers have much more efficient ways of breaching your credit card and getting your data,"" such as guessing weak passwords, or ""phishing"" calls pretending to be from the user's bank and asking them for their passwords.  ""The bigger issue will be making sure that their phone is secure. Passwords need to be unique and strong.""  Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

The cyclone that hit Mozambique on March 14th, killing perhaps 1,000 people, has further focused attention on the risks posed by rising temperatures. Even so, the man-made carbon emissions that drive global warming continue to grow. According to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a think-tank based in Paris, energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 1.7% last year, to 33.1 gigatonnes. The increase, of 560 metric tonnes compared with 2017, was equivalent to a full year’s worth of emissions from international aviation. Carbon emissions have been driven higher by increasing demand for all types of energy. Broadly speaking, changes in energy demand track the fortunes of the world economy. Robust global GDP growth of 3.7% last year caused energy demand to rise by some 2.3%, its fastest pace for a decade. And although energy efficiency did improve and use of renewable sources did increase—solar power generation rose by 31%—these gains were dwarfed by the growth in the use of fossil fuels, which accounted for 70% of the rise in global energy consumption. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Burning of coal, the most egregious source of carbon, accounted for a third of the growth in emissions. A new generation of coal-fired power plants in Asia was responsible for nearly all the additional global demand. Those power plants are expected to remain active for another 40 years. Much more encouragingly, and despite President Donald Trump’s advocacy for America’s coal industry, America’s abundant supply of natural gas has led firms rapidly to switch from coal to gas power. Natural-gas consumption in the United States increased by 10% last year, equivalent to Britain’s total annual consumption. Perhaps the most worrying finding in the report is the threat of a feedback loop between severe weather events and carbon emissions. According to the IEA, a hotter-than-average summer and colder-than-average winter led to greater use of heating and air conditioning, which together were responsible for about half of the rise in energy demand in America and roughly a fifth of the worldwide increase. If humans keep burning fuel to shield themselves from extreme temperatures, and the emissions produced by that activity cause temperatures to become ever more extreme, the worst-case scenarios for climate change are more likely to materialise.

The tech giant unveiled its Apple credit card through a partnership with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard on Monday. Apple is entering a crowded, competitive market filled with banks and newer fintech firms. While many of the perks on the Apple card are already available at competitors, the tech company's brand, massive customer base and new security features could help it carve out significant market share.  ""Money is just a form of data, and Apple has been great at managing access to data. They'll take the same approach to money over time,"" said Ryan Gilbert, general partner at Propel Ventures. ""Apple has raised the bar — we'll see most issuers rethinking their products and seeking to copy Apple.""   Apple users will be able to sign up for the new card this summer through their iPhones, according to the company. It's centered around Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment and digital wallet service that started in 2014. The card will also let users manage spending and rewards through the iPhone's Wallet app.  Among the features other card companies might want to copy is Apple's heightened security. The card will incorporate a one-time use authentication code that is protected by biometric security — either ""Touch ID"" or ""Face ID"" through the iPhone. The sleek, minimalist titanium card just has the holder's name etched onto it with lasers. It forgoes card numbers and other sensitive information.  If customers are able to trust Apple with their bank accounts, that could be ""the winning punch"" against other credit cards with similar perks.  ""That's an opportunity over existing banks, especially if you get hacked — Apple is known for that Apple store, Genius bar experience"" Gilbert said.  Apple's credit card comes with perks, but they're not entirely new. The card gives 2 percent cash back on Apple Pay transactions and 3 percent on direct Apple purchases. Customers get 1 percent on purchases with the physical card and the company said rewards are dispensed daily.       Source: Apple Titanium Apple Card   The interest rate on the Goldman Sachs-linked credit card are expected to range from roughly 13 percent to 24 percent. There's no teaser rate — which fintech companies and banks often use to attract customers. The card has no fees of any kind — that includes late fees, international fees or annual fees, according to Apple.  Other cards, like the Citi Double Cash card, also offer 2 percent cash back on all purchases while U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite card rewards mobile spending with 3 percent cash back and pays back 4.5 percent on travel.  Even if it's not the best rewards card, it could help build Apple Pay, said CB Insights' Max Abramsky.  ""Although Apple is late to the credit card game, its marketing clout and loyal customer base gives the company an opportunity to scale up quickly,"" Abramsky said. The Apple Cash rewards will encourage users to keep an account balance and ultimately spend it on online, for in-store purchases or by making peer-to-peer payments.  For Goldman, the move marks a further push into its new consumer financial products. Goldman Sachs rolled out its retail bank called Marcus in 2016. Until then, the investment bank was mostly known for catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors throughout its 150-year history.     Threat to fintech   The Apple Card is likely to put more competitive pressure on branded credit card issuers than on Goldman's fellow banks. But it is also likely a threat to fintech companies, especially if it goes after consumer deposits.  ""It is conceivable that Apple continues to offer more financial products to its customer base, particularly bank accounts which is quite complementary to credit accounts,"" said Kyle Lui, partner at venture capital firm DCM. ""That would be much more competitive to fintech unicorns like SoFi, Chime and even Robinhood.""  Fintech companies like Chime, Robinhood, Wealthfront and SoFi have been moving toward holding customer cash by launching cash accounts. Many of them tend to partner with smaller, regional banks instead of big institutions like Goldman and J.P. Morgan. If Apple were to go after deposits, smaller banks could take a hit.  ""Regional banks are going to have a tough time -- the big banks can still play defense,"" said Propel's Ryan Gilbert. ""Those who haven't done much exciting over time will see more pressure especially If direct deposits go to Apple.""  Square and PayPal might not be immune, either. Those payment firms have courted customers by offering small business loans, peer-to-peer payment apps, debit cards and credit cards in the case of PayPal.  ""This is really Apple putting on the boxing gloves not just to the likes of Netflix and Disney in streaming, but also Square and PayPal by going to after payments market share,"" said Dan Ives, managing director and equity analyst covering the technology sector at Wedbush. ""It really shows Apple loading up the arsenal getting ready to go.""           David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Jennifer Bailey, vice president at Apple Inc., speaks during an event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., on Monday, March 25, 2019.    Gene Munster of Loup Ventures estimated that Apple Pay is still only active on about 25 percent of all iPhones in the U.S. This could speed up adoption of Apple's payments system, since the card can be used anywhere unlike Apple Pay.  Apple is making inroads, even without the credit card. More than 70 percent of U.S. retailers now take Apple Pay, and roughly 40 countries will opt in by year-end, Cook said. Apple Pay is on track to pass 10 billion transactions this year, and will work in mass transit systems in New York, Chicago and Portland this year, Cook said in the presentation Tuesday.  Apple's success in capturing other areas of consumer's lives may be a key reason someone could decide to trust them with personal finance.  ""The Apple brand is such that if they started a new yogurt, Apple enthusiasts would buy that,"" Ives said. ""They want to build more of a fence around their backyard by going after the financial platform side of the customer.""  There are potential challenges, including demand for the card. Propel Venture's Gilbert said underwriting the demand could be a challenge. And Apple has to deal with the reality that they may have to turn people down depending on credit scores.  ""A credit card implies that you have credit,"" Gilbert said. ""How does this support Apple being the firm for everybody model? Can this be for everyone, or is it only for people with high quality credit?""  The revenue potential is also unproven. While this appears to represent an ""incremental benefit to users,"" the ""revenue opportunity of the Apple Card product is unclear at this point,"" Raymond James wrote in a note to clients after the announcement.  — CNBC's Hugh Son and Annie Nova contributed reporting.

Reuters/Thomas Peter          Apple unveiled its new TV streaming service on Monday, with stars like Oprah Winfrey in attendance at the launch event in California. But the idea that Apple TV is going to challenge Netflix's dominance anytime soon may be fanciful, according to an analyst note from investment bank Nomura. Nomura said Apple will need 8 million subscribers to generate sales of $1 billion. It took Netflix more than a decade to hit 8 million users, while CBS All Access had to wait five years to hit this figure. But Apple has a big ace up its sleeve: Its pre-existing user base. Apple unveiled its much-heralded TV streaming on Monday, with Hollywood royalty like Oprah Winfrey adding some stardust to the launch event at the tech giant's headquarters. The service, called Apple TV+, is being touted as a rival to Netflix , not least because Apple will use splashy original content to hook potential subscribers and reel them in. But the idea that Apple TV is going to challenge Netflix's dominance anytime soon may be fanciful — a reality highlighted in an analyst note from investment bank Nomura. Apple has spent anywhere between $1 billion and $2 billion on shows for Apple TV+, according to various reports. That cash has helped it lure stars like Reese Witherspoon and filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg. To access this content, Nomura estimates that Apple will charge people $10 a month for a subscription. At this price, Apple would need 8 million subscribers to break even at $1 billion, Nomura said — the lower end of what Apple is estimated to have spent on original programming. To put that in some context: It took Netflix more than a decade to hit 8 million subscribers . Founded in 1997, it reached 1 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2003, and did not hit the 8 million mark until the first three months of 2008, according to historical earnings. Read more: Apple has unveiled its long-awaited streaming TV service, Apple TV Plus. Here's how it compares to the other big streaming services, from Netflix to Prime Video. Now, these were the days when Netflix was almost exclusively an online DVD rental store and not the online entertainment behemoth it has now become. Perhaps a fairer example — and indeed the one used by Nomura — is CBS All Access. It took CBS five years to secure 8 million streaming subscribers . It did this two years ahead of schedule, but still, it shows the time it can take to build an online audience in a heavily saturated market. To further highlight the task ahead of Apple in challenging Netflix, the company behind ""Stranger Things"" now adds more than 8 million subscribers a quarter , such is its momentum around the world. That's more than it gained in its first decade of existence. ""We assume profitability will be low,"" was Nomura's somewhat withering final word on Apple TV+. Apple's secret weapon is its giant user base AP Photo/Tony Avelar But Apple has a big ace up its sleeve: Its pre-existing user base. Apple, unlike Netflix, has already gained a vast and near-religious following thanks to the success of products such as the iPhone. Where Netflix had to gain devotees from scratch, Apple already has an army: There were more than 900 million active iPhone users at the end of 2018. Or, as Oprah Winfrey put it: ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all."" Apple faces an uphill battle if it wants to seriously challenge Netflix. But if Tim Cook and company can somehow mobilise Apple's existing user base it might just stand a chance of toppling the TV streaming industry's Goliath.  This is a subscriber-only story.

Red flag laws—also called extreme risk protection orders—allow law enforcement or civilians to petition a judge to have firearms removed from the possession of someone who they believe is at risk of harming themselves or others. The individual has the opportunity to protest the order. If it’s enacted, however, they may not purchase or posses a firearm for a minimum of 180 days.  Fourteen states plus D.C. already have some form of red flag laws on the books, and other states have considered similar legislation.  Tuesday’s scheduled meeting allowed the Judiciary Committee to hear from a sheriff, a gun control advocate, a research director and law professor, a firearms prosecutor, and a representative from the National Alliance on Mental Illness.    Those in favor of red flag laws state the regulation can prevent violence, particularly suicides. Those in opposition argue that unless the law addresses the value of the second amendment and provides for due process, it can be used to disarm innocent people.  The hearing comes as the public is becoming increasingly aware of the trauma caused by mass shootings. Over the past week, two Parkland students and a father whose six-year-old daughter died in the Sandy Hook shooting each died in apparent suicides .  Red flag laws provide a temporary solution to those who family or friends may believe are a danger to themselves or others. The regulation has support from both sides of the isle: Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) proposing federal red flag laws after the 2018 Parkland school shooting, but it was unsuccessful. Sen. Marco Rubio re-introduced bipartisan legislation on red flag laws earlier this year, and the White House as shown support for such preventative laws as well.

A decade ago, the sight of new homes under construction in Maricopa, an enclave of tidy cul-de-sacs 35 miles from downtown Phoenix, was almost unimaginable. Four in five homeowners were underwater, with their outstanding mortgages worth more than their properties, according to housing data tracker Zillow. Neighbors felt compelled to cut the hedges and clean up garbage at empty houses. ...

Fourteen House Republicans support the measure, but it was not enough to reach a two-thirds majority.      Jacob Pramuk | @jacobpramuk   Published 2 Hours Ago  Updated  24 Mins Ago  CNBC.com                show chapters               House votes against overriding Trump's border emergency veto   2 Hours Ago |  00:48        House Democrats' attempt to override President Donald Trump 's first veto failed Tuesday, leaving the president's national emergency declaration in place for now.   The chamber fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to overcome the president's opposition to a resolution that would end his executive action. Only 14 Republicans joined with Democrats in voting to override the veto in a 248-181 vote — one more GOP representative than when the House passed the measure last month.  In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who authored the resolution, said the congressional votes would ""provide significant evidence for the courts as they review lawsuits"" challenging the move to secure money for the president's proposed border wall. They signaled the House would vote again on ending the national emergency in six months, which lawmakers can do as long as it is in effect.   ""The President's lawless emergency declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, and Congress will work through the appropriations and defense authorization processes to terminate this dangerous action and restore our constitutional system of balance of powers,"" they said following the vote. ""In six months, the Congress will have another opportunity to put a stop to this President's wrongdoing. We will continue to review all options to protect our Constitution and our Democracy from the President's assault.""       Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, speaks to members of the media while departing a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, March 26, 2019.   Last month, Trump declared a national emergency to divert money already approved by Congress to the construction of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats and some Republicans worried about Trump circumventing the legislature's appropriations power after lawmakers passed only about $1.4 billion of the $5.7 billion the president sought for structures.  Both the House and Senate previously passed the legislation to block the emergency declaration with bipartisan support.  Trump hopes to use the declaration to secure $3.6 billion of the $8 billion total he wants to put toward barriers on the border. It would come from the Defense Department's military construction budget. The president has argued he has the full authority to divert the funds.  Though Congress cannot terminate the emergency declaration for now, Trump's action still will face its share of scrutiny. Numerous states and outside groups have filed lawsuits challenging the declaration.  Lawsuits have in part cited Trump's own words last month, when he said ""I didn't need to do this"" to get border wall funding, ""but I'd rather do it much faster.""  After acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Monday that the Pentagon would move $1 billion away from military construction projects to build the border wall, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wa., denied the move. He said his committee had not approved it.  It still may go through, as the Pentagon will argue it has the authority to use the funds.  Trump also requested $8.6 billion for border wall construction in his fiscal 2020 budget, which could spark yet another standoff with Democrats over his signature campaign promise .

Both make troubling news for anyone who thinks that students should be exposed to a broad range of ideas, including some they won’t agree with. One concerns a global celebrity, the other a man who is relatively little known outside his own specialist world. Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychology professor and conservative culture warrior, revealed on March 20th that an invitation to take up a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University had been withdrawn. The University’s Divinity Faculty confirmed the decision in a laconic statement: “We can confirm that Jordan Peterson requested a visiting fellowship, and an initial offer has been rescinded after a further review.” Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Mr Peterson had quite a lot more to say about the matter. He recalled that he had visited the British city of Cambridge last autumn and made a successful appearance at a famous debating society. He had also had some enjoyable conversations with members of the Divinity Faculty which made him think that collaborating with them might be beneficial for one of his longer-term projects: a series of commentaries on the Hebrew scriptures which had already attracted millions of followers. (With his pronouncements on self-help and his appeal to relatively old-fashioned ideas about gender, the professor reaches far more people through the internet than will ever crowd into a lecture room.) He had some quite caustic things to say about the decision to disinvite him. ...It is deeply unfortunate that the authorities at the Divinity school in Cambridge decided that kowtowing to an ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob trumped participating in an extensive online experiment in mass Christian and psychological education. Given the continued decline of church attendance, the rise in atheistic or agnostic sentiment, the increasing irrelevance of theological education and the collapse in interest in such mattters among young people, wiser and more profound decisions might have been made. Ideologically addled or otherwise, the Cambridge University Student Union hailed news of the dis-invitation, saying, “[Mr Peterson’s] work and views are not representative of the student body and...we do not see his [potential] visit as a valuable contribution to the University, but one that works in opposition to the principles of the University.” Mr Peterson dismissed this statement as barely intelligible. As it is, the Cambridge Divinity Faculty has always encompassed a wide range of metaphysical beliefs, from Christian to Muslim to agnostic. At Queen’s University Belfast, by contrast, the teaching of theology to undergraduates has at least until recently been delegated to one Christian denomination. The Union Theological College, a Presbyterian-run institution, has been responsible for delivering theology classes and hence for deciding who will teach that subject. A liberal-minded minister-cum-academic, Laurence Kirkpatrick, has just been fired from his post at the institution where he has worked for 22 years. The Presbyterian professor has been in dispute with the college since a radio interview he gave in June 2018 when he said its teaching staff were almost entirely elderly and male (“we must look like escapees from an old people’s home”) and also questioned the church’s increasingly hard-line teaching on same-sex relationships. (At the time, Northern Ireland’s Presbyterians were in the process of loosening links with their Scottish brethren in protest at the latter’s increasingly gay-friendly stance. Mr Kirkpatrick said: “I’d be broken-hearted if anyone said I’d been bigoted against a Catholic or gay student.”) This led to his suspension; in the last few days he has been formally dismissed. Apparently because of concerns about the way Mr Kirkpatrick was being treated, Queen’s University suspended the introduction of new students to the college last December. That could be a step towards the complete severance of connections between the University and the theological outfit. The professor said he was told by the college that he had been responsible for “fracturing” its relationship with the university. His radio interview had brought both the college and the Presbyterian church into “disrepute”, according to his letter of dismissal. He has said he will appeal to the Employment Tribunal. What Mr Peterson and Mr Kirkpatrick have in common is that both have confronted boldly the reality that theology in its conventional form is of little interest to young people. They may have rather different ideas on how that lacuna should be filled. But in both cases, there are people who do not want them to be given a hearing.

Sitemap    Disclaimer    Commerce Policy    Coupons    Made in NYC   Stock quotes by finanzen.net                     The NCAA brings in $1 billion a year — here's why it refuses to pay its college athletes        Steve Cameron  8m                                             The NCAA brought in $1 billion of revenue during the 2016-2017 school year — most of which was generated by the Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known as March Madness . Regardless of how much money the NCAA makes, it refuses to pay college athletes . NCAA athletes are also prohibited from profiting off of their name, image, or likeness. The NCAA uses ""amateurism"" to justify these terms in courtrooms, but former athletes are pushing for a share of the revenue. Following is a transcript of the video: Narrator: In the 2016-2017 school year, NCAA revenue reached $1 billion. Many people have argued that the players who drive this revenue don't receive the true value that they bring to their schools. John Oliver: There is nothing inherently wrong with a sporting tournament making huge amounts of money, but there is something slightly troubling about a billion-dollar sports enterprise where the athletes are not paid a penny. Narrator: John has a point. So why is it that student-athletes aren't paid? Let's start by looking through recent lawsuits against the NCAA. In response to the release of EA Sports' popular NCAA video games, former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon filed a federal lawsuit against the NCAA over whether Division I men's basketball and football players should be compensated for the commercial use of their names, images, and likenesses. After appeals, the final outcome was that even though the NCAA's amateurism rules are unlawful, the fact that it lets colleges compensate student-athletes with the cost of college attendance, the NCAA frees itself from antitrust violations. And in March 2019, there was a slight change to that ruling. In the US District Court, Judge Claudia Wilken ruled to allow each conference and its member schools to provide additional education-related benefits without NCAA caps and prohibitions. Her ruling tethers payment to education, so instead of cash, student-athletes will be allowed to receive computers or scholarships for post-graduate degrees. In each trial, the NCAA has argued that amateurism keeps it from becoming an anticompetitive trust. So what is amateurism? In page four of the NCAA Division I handbook under the heading ""The Principle of Amateurism,"" the NCAA declares student-athletes shall be amateurs in an intercollegiate sport, and their participation should be motivated primarily by education and by the physical, mental, and social benefits to be derived. To clarify that, Oliver Luck, the NCAA's former executive vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a speech in 2015, ""It would be a bad mistake to create campus employer-employee relationships with student-athletes."" Paying college athletes ""would distract in a very significant way from pursuing what they really need to pursue - an education... And we need to emphasize the value of that education."" But let's think about that for a second. Are student-athletes able to receive the full value of that education? Richard Sherman: No, I don't think college athletes are given enough time to really take advantage of the free education that they're given. Narrator: Former student-athletes argue that the time commitment of playing a college sport, especially at the Division I level, impedes their ability to take advantage of their educational opportunity. Sherman: Show me how you're gonna get all your work done when after you get out at 7:30 or so you got a test the next day, you're dead tired from practice, and you still have to study just as hard as everybody else every day and get all of the same work done. Narrator: In fact, CBS Sports published a study on the topic with data from the Pac-12, the league Sherman competed in while at Stanford. The study surveyed 409 Pac-12 student-athletes and found 54% of athletes say they don't have enough time to study for tests, 80% of athletes say they have missed a class for competition during the academic year, and overall, athletes spend 50 hours a week on athletics. And while student-athletes feel they have the resources at their disposal to succeed academically, they don't have the time to do so. Reporter: The University of North Carolina today reeling from a blow, a really big blow, to its reputation, especially the integrity of its legendary sports program. Narrator: The University of North Carolina even went as far as committing academic fraud for 18 years. Advisers enrolled students in paper classes, which were fake classes used to inflate student-athlete GPAs to keep them eligible to play. So in many cases, these student-athletes are not receiving the education they're promised, the cost of which is by law how they're compensated. But beyond that, the cost of that education is lower than the revenue most big school athletic departments bring in. In 2014, the 10 schools that made the most money in college sports averaged revenue that was $132.5 million more than the average those schools spent on scholarships. Skip Bayless: So you get a free ride at school, but you deserve so much more than that. Stephen A. Smith: The NCAA has been allowed to be the flaming hypocrites that they are, getting away with the multitude of things that they have gotten away with in an effort to exploit these kids for years and years and years. Colin Cowherd: It's time to now pay players. Narrator: In her latest ruling, Judge Wilken denied a free market scholarship model, and the idea of paying student-athletes raises a lot of questions. Scott Davis: There would be such a large disparity between some of the athletes, and it's no different than the pros where the best players are getting paid and lower players are not, even when you trickle down to other sports that are not making as much money or generating as much attention as football or basketball. Bernard Muir: We have 36 sports, many of the sports you've just mentioned. We would have to kind of concentrate to a small number in order to pay student-athletes. Davis: There would be less incentive to go to class because they would essentially have a job already if they were earning, like, their true value to the schools. Narrator: Despite these arguments, some writers have devised plans to pay athletes the value they add to their schools. Deadspin published, ""So what is the best plan for playing players? No plan at all,"" arguing to treat them like any other employee and that the free market is the best solution, similar to the proposal in Judge Wilken's court. SB Nation suggests the NCAA adopts the Olympic model of amateurism in which the athletes are free to gain endorsement deals and sell autographs. And LZ Granderson has called for government intervention. Granderson: It is way more complicated than just handing out checks, as well, and so I think Congress actually needs to get involved a lot more than what's happening right now. Narrator: This issue is far from decided and likely won't be anytime soon. Let us know what you think in the comments. Do you believe college athletes deserve to be paid? If you do, what model do you think works best?

In another two decades the ratio will be two-to-one, according to a recent analysis by Torsten Sløk of Deutsche Bank. The trend has economists worried about everything from soaring pension costs to “secular stagnation”—the chronically weak growth that comes from having too few investment opportunities to absorb available savings. The world’s greying is inevitable. But its negative effects on growth are not. If older societies grow more slowly, that may be because they prefer familiarity to dynamism. Ageing slows growth in several ways. One is that there are fewer new workers to boost output. Workforces in some 40 countries are already shrinking because of demographic change. As the number of elderly people increases, governments may neglect growth-boosting public investment in education and infrastructure in favour of spending on pensions and health care. People in work, required to support ever more pensioners, must pay higher taxes. But the biggest hit to growth comes from weakening productivity. A study published in 2016, for example, examined economic performance across American states. It found that a rise of 10% in the share of a state’s population that is over 60 cuts the growth rate of output per person by roughly half a percentage point, with two-thirds of that decline due to weaker growth in productivity.

Though some capabilities, notably physical ones, deteriorate with age, the overall effect is not dramatic. A study of Germany’s manufacturing sector published in 2016 failed to detect a drop-off in productivity in workers up to the age of 60. Companies can tweak employees’ roles as they get older in order to make best use of their comparative advantages, such as extensive experience and professional connections. Furthermore, if weak productivity growth was caused by older workers producing less, pay patterns should reflect that. Wages would tend to rise at the beginning of a career and fall towards its end. But that is not what usually happens. Rather, according to a recent paper by economists at Moody’s Analytics, a consultancy, wages are lower for everyone in companies with lots of older workers. It is not older workers’ falling productivity that seems to hold back the economy, but their influence on those around them. That influence is potent: the authors reckon that as much as a percentage point of America’s recent decline in annual productivity growth could be associated with ageing. How this influence makes itself felt is unclear. But the authors suggest that companies with more older workers might be less eager to embrace new technologies. That might be because they are reluctant to make investments that would require employees to be retrained, given the shorter period over which they could hope to make a return on that training for those near the end of their careers. Or older bosses might be to blame. Research indicates that younger managers are more likely to adopt new technologies than are older ones. This may seem obvious: older people’s greater aversion to new technology is a cliché. And at least anecdotally, greying industries do seem more averse to change. If the evidence suggested that ageing economies struggled primarily because of slow-growing labour forces and fast-growing pension costs, it would make sense to focus policy efforts on keeping people in work longer—by raising retirement ages, for example. But if, as seems to be the case, reticence to embrace new technologies is a bigger issue, other goals should take priority—in particular, boosting competition. In America, increasing industrial concentration and persistently high profits are spurring renewed interest in antitrust rules. The benefits of breaking up powerful firms and increasing competition might be even bigger than thought, if conservative old firms are thereby spurred to make better use of newer technologies. There are other measures that could help. Removing barriers to job-switching, for example by making benefits more portable, could shorten average tenures and help stop companies’ cultures becoming ossified. Best of all would be more immigration. An influx of young foreign workers would address nearly all the ways in which population ageing depresses growth. It would not only expand the labour force and create new taxpayers, but would mean more and younger companies, and greater openness to new technologies. And there would be plenty of willing takers in poorer countries with younger populations. No men for old country Societies with lots of older workers are also societies with lots of older voters, however. Those voters are, on average, more politically conservative than younger people, and less likely to support increased immigration. People of all ages would gain from policies that boosted growth and productivity. But given the choice between a dynamic but unfamiliar society and a static but familiar one, older countries tend to opt for the second. In hindsight, the demographic boom that coincided with industrialisation in rich countries may have had an underappreciated benefit: it created a big constituency in favour of embracing new technologies and the opportunities they provided. Technology may at some point overcome the stifling effect of ageing. In a new paper Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University find that when young workers are sufficiently scarce, manufacturers invest in more automation, and experience faster productivity growth as a result. Robots have yet to make a big impact in the service sector and beyond, but as their capabilities improve and jobs for younger people go begging that may change. The world could use more flexibility and productivity now. But stagnation may end eventually, once the robots are promoted to management.

Sabre, a Texas-based tech company that provides support to the aforementioned airlines, took responsibility and apologized for the since-resolved technological glitch in an early afternoon tweet , noting it “experienced a system issue that impacted some customers.”  Although the company didn’t specify the cause of the malfunction, or how long it lasted, some airlines began fielding customers’ concerned tweets about being unable to access the companies’ websites beginning around 9 a.m. ET.  But the issue appeared to really come to a head two hours later, when a larger volume of passengers noted that they were unable to board their flights due to a system crash. Pictures from Boston Logan Airport to Seattle’s SeaTac Airport to Fort Lauderdale showed crowds of passengers and agents alike having difficulty checking in.

Can’t check in at kiosk either. Been waiting in line with many others and not getting any updates. Check-in isn’t moving and gate agents are asking if “ANYONE” has a paper boarding pas.  — Eric Robinson (@emikerob) March 26, 2019       Sabre, which didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment, acknowledged the issue in an 11:56 a.m. tweet , although Newsweek  reports that the problem had already been resolved for some airlines by then.  “Technical teams were immediately engaged,” Sabre tweeted an hour later. “Systems have recovered and customers are reporting normal operations. We apologize for the inconvenience to those affected.”  Individual airlines were quick to note that the issue was with an outside source’s system.  “Earlier today, Sabre had a brief technical issue that impacted multiple carriers, including American Airlines ,” an airline spokesperson told Fortune via email. “This technical issue has been resolved. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”  JetBlue also apologized to those who were impacted by the technical problem, telling Fortune , “All functions have been restored following a temporary outage of Sabre’s systems that impacted multiple airlines.”  Sabre doesn’t exclusively work with airlines.  In 2016, the company made headlines due to a massive data breach of its hotel reservation system— serving 32,000 properties including Trump Hotels—that compromised consumers’ credit card numbers and security codes.

Sarah Whitten | Dan Mangan   Published 5 Hours Ago  Updated  59 Mins Ago  CNBC.com              Kamil Krzaczynski | Reuters Actor Jussie Smollett leaves court after charges against him were dropped by state prosecutors in Chicago, Illinois, March 26, 2019.   Chicago prosecutors on Tuesday abruptly dropped criminal charges against ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett, who was accused of staging a phony hate crime against himself.   Smollett, who had faced 16 counts of disorderly conduct, appeared at an emergency court hearing Tuesday morning, where the case was dismissed in exchange for the actor agreeing to forfeit his $10,000 release bond.  There had been no suggestion in recent court filings or media reports that Smollett's case would be tossed out. Smollett had pleaded not guilty March 14, and before Tuesday's surprise hearing was next scheduled to be in court on April 17.   ""This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said at a press conference where he and police blasted the dismissal.  He said Smollett ""did this all in the name of self-promotion.""  ""How dare you!"" Emanuel said of the 36-year-old Smollett.  The mayor said that Smollett's alleged deception meant that future actual victims of hate crimes would be under a cloud of suspicion when they report being targeted for their race, sexual orientation or religion.  ""This sends an unambiguous message that there is no accountability, and that is wrong,"" Emanuel said of the case being dropped.  Smollett, who is black and gay, told Chicago police in January that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home around 2 a.m. The actor said the men beat him, shouted racist and homophobic comments, poured a chemical substance on him, looped a rope around his neck and then fled.  Two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, were arrested in February for allegedly being connected to the attack, but later were released without charges. The Osundairos told police that Smollett wrote them a check for $3,500 to carry out the purported attack.  Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Tuesday that police ""found out about [the dismissal] when you all did.""  ""Do I think justice was served? No. ... They chose to hide behind secrecy in brokering a deal,"" Johnson said.   Tweet   But Smollett, after the case was dropped, said, ""I've been truthful and consistent on every level since day one.""  ""I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of even one drop of what I have been accused of.""  ""This has been an incredibly difficult time, honestly, one of the worst in my entire life,"" he said.  ""I want to thank my legal counsel from the bottom of my heart, and I would like to thank the state of Illinois for attempting to do what is right. Thank you for all the support, thank you for faith and thank you to God.""       Source: Chicago PD A mugshot of actor Jussie Smollett after making false crimes charge.   There was no plea deal in the case, whose records have now been sealed as a result of the dismissal.  A spokesman for Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx, whose office was prosecuting Smollett, said, ""After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case.  Foxx recused herself from the investigation in February after facilitating conversations between Smollett's family and the Chicago Police Department. She initially cited ""potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case"" as the reason for stepping away from the case.  Smollett's legal team, in a statement, reiterated its claim that Smollett was the victim of an actual attack.  ""Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint against him,"" Smollett's legal team said. ""Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29th.""  The dismissal is a ""stunning, surprising turn of events. Like something you might see on Mr. Smollett's TV show,"" Georgetown University Law professor Paul Butler said on MSNBC.  Chicago Police Department Commander Edward Wodnicki, whose department had conducted the investigation into Smollett, told WMAQ-TV he was outraged by the dismissal.  ""It's a punch in the gut. Is absolutely a punch in the gut,"" Wodnicki said. ""We worked closely throughout our three-week investigation to get to the point where we arrested the offender. For the state's attorney at this point to dismiss charges without discussing this with us at all is just shocking.""  ""They weren't courteous to give us a heads-up"" about the dismissal, he said.  ""This is a slap in our face.""  Wodnicki said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" against Smollett and called the case against him ""rock solid.""  ""We wasted time and effort on a reported serious crime to get to the point it's a lie?"" Wodnicki said. ""I want reimbursement,"" he said, noting that the Chicago PD had spent more than $10,000 on the probe.  ""Citizens should be angry,"" Wodnicki said.  Emanuel said Smollett's claim of the assault had dragged the city of Chicago's name ""through the mud.""  ""I support the hard work of our police,"" Emanuel said.  He noted that a grand jury had indicted Smollett and that the case was accepted by prosecutors weeks ago.  It is not clear whether the dismissal will affect a separate investigation by the FBI into a letter that threatened Smollett and which was sent to the studio where ""Empire"" is filmed shortly before the alleged attack on Smollett.  Chicago police have said that Smollett himself sent that letter.  Smollett has not been charged by federal authorities in connection with the letter. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago, which would handle any federal prosecution of Smollett if it were to be initiated, declined to comment.  In the wake of Smollett's arrest in February, producers of the 20th Century Fox Television show ""Empire"" decided to remove the actor from the final two episodes of the latest season. Warner Bros. -owned TNT also pulled an episode of ""Drop the Mic"" that featured Smollett.  In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox Entertainment said, ""Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.""  As of last week, 20th Century Fox Television is owned by Disney .   Tweet   ""Our son and brother is an innocent man whose name and character has been unjustly smeared,"" said the Smollett family in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Jussie is a son, a brother, a partner, a champion for human rights, and a genuine soul who would never be capable of what he was falsely accused of. He was the victim of an assault and then falsely blamed for his own attack.""  The statement continued, ""This morning truth has prevailed and he has been vindicated. All charges have been dismissed and his record expunged (cleared). The painful incidents we've witnessed him endure over the past 7 weeks have been heartbreaking and unjust to say the least. While many were quick to rush to judgement before hearing the actual truth, we are grateful that the truth about Jussie has come to light. We look forward to bringing the real perpetrators to justice. We thank God and our village for standing by us during this trying time.""  Smollett's attorneys had included celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos. On Monday, Geragos was identified as a co-conspirator of lawyer Michael Avenatti in an alleged scheme by Avenatti to extort up to $25 million from athletic shoe giant Nike by threatening to release damaging information about that company.  Geragos has not been criminally charged in that case.  Patricia Brown Holmes, a lawyer for Smollett, said the $3,500 that Smollett gave the brothers who claimed the attack was staged actually was payment for nutrition and training.

Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan is losing popularity among Americans, according to a new poll.  Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images          The luster of "" Medicare for All ,"" the healthcare plan advanced by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is starting to fade. According to a new poll, 43% of Americans think Medicare for All is a good idea, while 45% say it is a bad idea. 51% of people said it was a good idea in August 2017, while 38% said it was a bad idea. But a Medicare buy-in option, advanced by more moderate Democrats, is much more popular. 51% of people surveyed supported that idea, while just 30% were against it. Americans are starting to cool on the idea of "" Medicare for All ,"" but there is a more moderate Democratic proposal that still captures the public's attention, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University poll found that support for the Medicare for All idea, which has been advanced by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , has slipped substantially over the last year and a half. In August 2017, 51% of Americans thought Medicare for All was a ""good idea,"" while just 38% thought it was a ""bad idea."" In the poll released Tuesday, the percentage of Americans calling Medicare for All a ""good idea"" was down to 43%, while 45% said it was a ""bad idea."" Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance and enroll all Americans on the government's healthcare program. While the idea would drive up the government's spending , advocates argue that the savings for average people — who would no longer have to pay insurance premiums — and the streamlining of the healthcare system would result in savings for the healthcare system as a whole . But the idea also includes tax increases to help offset some of the government spending , which previous polling has shown drives down people's acceptance of the idea .

A Medicare buy-in, in which people could either keep their private insurance or choose to shift to the government's Medicare program, actually attracted support from a majority of people. 51% of Americans said the buy-in option was a ""good idea,"" while just 30% said it is a ""bad idea."" The Medicare buy-in drew much more support among Democrats and independents, but even a plurality of self-described Republicans liked the idea. 43% said it was a ""good idea,"" while 39% said the buy-in was a ""bad idea."" A number of more moderate Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates like Beto O'Rourke , have pushed for a Medicare buy-in plan. Others have suggested that the US should lower the age that people qualify for Medicare to 50 from the current standard of 65. While the Quinnipiac poll does not give reasons for the fall in the popularity of Medicare for All, there are a number of factors that could be in play. For one thing, the increased visibility of Medicare for All — which has gone from a fringe solution to part of the political mainstream — could have exposed more people to the specifics of the idea. Additionally, many Democrats were vague about their meaning of Medicare for All — sometimes combining the idea with the Medicare buy-in. As those terms get more well defined, it appears most people are gravitating toward the less extreme option.

Shannon Stapleton/Reuters          Financial firms like JPMorgan Chase, Aflac, KKR, Blackstone, and Och-Ziff Capital all added #MeToo language to their most recent annual reports, warning investors about potential company harm from harassment. Before 2018, the word ""sexual"" had only been mentioned once in the risk section a publicly traded financial company's annual report. So far in 2019, it has been in nine different financial companies' public filings. Even though the # MeToo movement has not brought the same reckoning on the finance industry as it has on Hollywood, politics, media, and other sectors, banks, insurance agencies, and hedge funds are still thinking about the risks of a possible scandal. Or, at least, their lawyers are. Public financial companies have significantly stepped up the use of several #MeToo words and phrases in their 2018 annual reports, according to a review of 10K filings by data company Sentieo, specifically in their sections focused on risks facing their businesses. While the word ""sexual"" wasn't listed as a risk factor for any financial companies in 2017, by the next year it appeared in filings for three such companies. So far in 2019, the word has appeared in nine companies' 10-Ks' risk section. The use of the word ""harassment"" has also increased. In 2017 and 2018, it appeared in seven finance firms' annual reports each year. So far in 2019, it has more than doubled, to 15 financial services companies. The updated language in companies' annual reports show that the impact of the movement is being closely monitored by the top brass of the financial industry. Companies that have added the word ""sexual"" to their risk sections over the last two years include: private equity giants KKR and Apollo Global Management; insurance company Aflac; and Ken Moelis's investment bank, Moelis & Co. Major companies like JPMorgan Chase, Carlyle Group and Blackstone were among the firms that have added ""harassment"" to their risk factors this year. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider ""We have seen #MeToo push out quite a few executives since the wave started so we are not surprised to see language around the topic make its way in SEC filings,"" said Nick Mazing, director of research at Sentieo. The movement, which started in 2017, has brought the alleged sexual misconduct of powerful men like Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, and others to light. While there have been isolated incidents in the finance industry , the movement has had an impact on workplace culture, like a reluctance to have one-on-one meetings with women and a cutback in corporate holiday parties . Venture capital firms and investment banks have also pushed to add in a "" Weinstein clause "" to contracts to protect investments into companies that are then plagued by sexual harassment scandals. See more: D.E. Shaw fired a high-profile hedge-fund manager after an investigation into alleged inappropriate behavior, and now he's fighting back Some firms are more #MeToo targeted than others. Blackstone and Carlyle's risk factors sections added the language to focus on companies the private equity firms invest in potentially violating ""anti-harassment"" laws, but did not mention the firms' own employees. JPMorgan added in a line that said the firm could be in trouble if employees ""engaged in discriminatory behavior or harassment"" — a catch-all statement that would protect against a variety of potential scandals. See more: Hedge funds are watching a key lawsuit involving LinkedIn to see if they can spend billions on web-scraped data Yet other additions are more clearly #MeToo related. Och-Ziff Capital Management specifically tweaked its language to include a line on employee misconduct and other ""inappropriate or unlawful behavior"" that is ""directed to other employees."" Apollo Global Management added a line to its annual report saying ""sexual harassment"" by employees, sub-contractors or consultants could hurt the company's brand and reputation ""regardless of ultimate outcome"" because of the headline risk. Moelis states that ""sexual harassment"" by employees would hurt not only the firm's recruitment of clients but also talent retention due to negative publicity. ""It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and there can be no assurance that the precautions we take to prevent and detect misconduct will be effective in all cases,"" Moelis' most recent annual report reads. The companies named above either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment except for Aflac, which said in a statement that ""we regularly review our disclosures to reflect the current business environment in a variety of ways. We believe that this is a responsible approach and will continue to pursue it going forward."" The disclosures, says Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, are an acknowledgement of the ""business environment right now."" ""It's protection against securities fraud,"" he said. ""If something does happen, you don't want investors coming to you and saying 'why didn't you warn us about this.'"" And don't expect the language to be removed from filings if the movement dies down, said Greg Kramer, a partner at Haynes and Boone who focuses on securities law. The focus on adding #MeToo-related clauses to public filings is reminiscent to him of how companies added language about sleazy accounting practices that resulted in several corporate scandals in the late 1990s and early 2000s. ""Companies adopted internal accounting controls to prevent these type of accounting practices to happen again, while also listing out in their public filings that this is a risk,"" Kramer said. ""The most important thing here is for companies to have strong policies and procedures around this type of action so they can prevent something like this from happening.""

NASA estimates the budget for ACSC would grow to $2.4 billion by fiscal year 2024. The huge increase in this year's budget request for ACSC is the result of an internal battle at NASA, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC.      Michael Sheetz | @thesheetztweetz   Published 1 Hour Ago  CNBC.com              Bettmann | Getty Images   In a potential boon for private space companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, NASA is asking Congress for billions of dollars over the next five years to speed the development spacecraft capable of flying humans to and from the moon.   NASA requested $363 million for fiscal year 2020 for the Advanced Cislunar and Surface Capabilities (ACSC) program, more than double what the space agency sought last year. More importantly, NASA estimates the budget for the program would grow to $2.4 billion by fiscal year 2024, as the agency begins to award companies with development contracts.         The huge increase in this year's budget request for ACSC is the result of an internal battle at NASA, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday. This year's introduction of a competitive bidding process means that companies would build their own spacecraft, with help from competitive NASA funding awards, rather than build a NASA-specific spacecraft.   NASA didn't respond to CNBC requests for comment.  After the establishment of the National Space Council, President Donald Trump's administration looked to work with the growing private space sector on multiple NASA programs. A main directive was to create a sustained U.S. presence on the moon. NASA would first send robots to the surface without crews, later following up with astronauts.  Recently appointed NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine supported a White House plan last year to make ACSC a competitive process between companies, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. But some NASA leaders rejected the idea, wanting to stick with the development of an in-house lunar lander project, one of the people said.  Known as the ""Flexible Lunar Explorer"" (or FLEx) lander concept, some at NASA wanted a system built for the agency, rather than according to the companies building the spacecraft. This is NASA's traditional method of awarding contracts, exemplified by the Boeing -built Space Launch System (SLS) rocket – which is now years behind and racking up billions of dollars in cost overruns.  With delays in the SLS program, privately-built rockets are being increasingly considered to launch NASA missions. And now, despite internal hesitancy, NASA is considering commercial alternatives for getting astronauts to the moon's surface. The agency has spoken to companies about enabling ""regular access to the lunar surface,"" NASA said in its budget request earlier this month.  The increased funding for ACSC also matches with statements Vice President Mike Pence made on Tuesday at a National Space Council meeting. Pence said it is the White House policy ""to return American astronauts to the moon within the next five years."" Although he said the SLS rocket must be accelerated to do so, he urged NASA to reach the moon ""by any means necessary.""  ""We're not committed to any one contractor. If our current contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones that will,"" Pence said. ""If American industry can provide critical commercial services without government development then we'll buy them.""  Musk welcomed Pence's comments, saying in a tweet that ""it would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!""     More competition driving cheaper spaceflight   The budget request said ACSC would look at acquisition opportunities through public-private partnerships. In essence, this would structure the ACSC financial awards and development process in a competitive structure. Or, as Pence put it, buying the services rather than developing them in-house.  In the past decade, NASA's commercial cargo and commercial crew have enabled the agency to buy flights to the International Space Station at competitive prices. After providing development awards, NASA has bought flights from SpaceX, Northrop Grumman -owned Orbital Sciences and Boeing .  In the case of the Commercial Crew program, NASA officials said a recent critical flight test of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule ""did better than expected."" Although delayed in development, many in the space industry point to the Commercial Crew program as another example of how private companies can fulfill government needs that used to be kept fully in-house. Once flight tests are complete, NASA will fly astronauts on SpaceX's capsule at a price of $58 million a seat (less than the $81 million a seat it costs NASA to fly astronauts on Russian Soyuz rockets).  As Trump's budget request has yet to be finalized, the details of ACSC may still change. Moreover, the earliest ACSC funding would not be awarded until late 2020, NASA's request said.  How NASA expects to shift funds so heavily to ACSC also remains in question. When asked by reporters, NASA's deputy CFO Andrew Hunter said there were ""some out-year assumptions"" of funds for the International Space Station in 2023 and 2024 that NASA will re-examine. Additionally, NASA senior budget analyst Brian Dewhurst said the ""lunar gateway"" program ""will largely be done in its development phase by that point, and so we'll be taking those dollars.""

The popular comic books by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo centres on a small tribe of Gauls somewhere in northern France around 50BC, surrounded by Roman invaders and holding out nonetheless thanks to a magic potion endowing them with superhuman strength. That hold-out image rather sums up Europe’s self image today; at least in the eyes of some of its most powerful leaders. When this afternoon the European Parliament in Strasbourg endorsed a contentious new Copyright Directive, it was just another instance of this Asterixian thinking, which is most pronounced in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The directive, which passed by 348 votes to 274, seeks to update the EU’s copyright legislation in light of recent technological changes. Its most controversial elements, passed much more narrowly, are its Article 11, a “link tax” requiring social networks and news aggregators to pay publishers to display snippets of their output, and most of all Article 13, an “upload filter” making larger online publishers like YouTube responsible for copyright infringements in material uploaded by their users. The directive now goes to the Council, which is expected to ratify it on April 9th. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. That caps two years of fraught debates and campaigning about the new rules. Supporters include musicians and publishers who say that it will help to protect artists in an age where unauthorised copying is drastically easier than it used to be. Opponents, which include net freedom campaigners and the likes of Google, say it amounts to censorship and will curb the use of established material to make memes or other parodies. Both sides have lobbied hard in Brussels and national capitals, deploying high-profile supporters like Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney (in favour) and Tim Berners-Lee (against). The anti-Article 13 campaign was particularly vocal in Germany. Though it attracted an unusual degree of interest for a piece of EU legislation, the Copyright Directive ought not to be viewed in isolation. By purporting to protect artists from the side effects of new technology, it represents a typical example of what Emmanuel Macron, the French president and a supporter of the reform, calls “l’Europe qui protège”, or “the Europe that protects”. Mr Macron believes that the rise of populism and public angst about globalisation demands an EU that, rather than merely welcoming the bracing winds of change, does more to shelter established interest groups from them. Though they use different language, the European Commission and the German government among others take a similar view. Other instances include the new Franco-German push (this one at odds with the Commission) to rejig competition rules to allow takeovers shielding European industry from unfair competition from American and in particular Chinese giants; new protections for European firms deemed strategically important; a more permissive approach to certain forms of state aid; digital consumer protections like the new General Data Protection Regulation; measures to tackle Russian-backed disinformation campaigns; a crackdown on tax avoidance; and tougher controls on migration at Europe’s outer borders and the pursuit of criminals within them. The European election manifesto of Germany’s Christian Democrats, published yesterday, was typical of the genre: “our Europe strengthens: security, peace and prosperity” it proclaimed (its most striking proposal was the creation of a “European FBI” to take on cross-border crime). So too were the warnings about “respecting European unity” issued by Mr Macron and Angela Merkel at their meeting with Xi Jinping, China’s president, in Paris on Tuesday, March 26th. All of which reflects a Europe that, seen from its most powerful capitals, looks like Asterix’s village: surrounded by threats. To the east: a malign Russia and increasingly aggressive China. To the south: a demographically churning Africa and an unstable Middle East. To the west: an unpredictable America. And within European societies: criminals and economic shifts and transformative technological developments that threaten established players and ways of life (to which, for example, the gilets jaunes protests in France might be considered one particularly prominent reaction). Europe’s core is determined to strengthen its defences against these threats. To protect an open Europe, goes the logic, Europe needs more protection against the excesses of openness. That seems sensible. And some of the measures implemented in the name of a protective Europe are reasonable enough. But it all poses some difficult questions deserving of more of a debate than they have received. Openness is supposed to be a European strength—its magic potion, to extend the Asterix metaphor—in an age when America is pulling up the drawbridge and China’s more closed model is making strides. But where do the limits of this strength lie? Which forms of protection are valid and which represent unacceptable compromises with more closed systems like the Chinese one? And where does that openness itself need protection? The Copyright Directive is one fault line in this much wider debate, one that goes to the heart of Europe’s values. The looming European election campaign is a rare chance to conduct that debate openly and on a continent-wide scale. It should not be missed.

Now Uber's paying $3.1 billion to buy it.        Graham Rapier  7m                                                         Mudassir Sheikha, co-founder and chief executive officer of Careem, attends the Day 1 of the RISE Conference 2018 in Hong Kong. tr  S3studio/Getty Images          Uber is buying Careem , its major rival in the Middle East, for $3.1 billion. For Uber, it's a way to buy dominance in a fiercely competitive region. Careem has built quite a moat to keep out western competition, founder and CEO Mudassir Sheikha told Business Insider in a recent interview. Just weeks ahead of its highly anticipated IPO, Uber announced a $3.1 billion deal to acquire one of its largest rivals in the Middle East, Careem. While Careem will remain an independent brand, Uber will acquire key insights and technology that the company has developed over the past seven years. Founder and CEO Mudassir Sheikha says that the moat carved out by Careem would be hard for a Western company to easily overcome. In an interview with Business Insider in February, Sheikha explained that certain things that Western companies take for granted — like ubiquitous credit cards or even Google Maps — don't always exist in the countries where Careem operates. ""We not only had to build mapping infrastructure, we had to build our own places database because Google was not complete nor reliable,"" Sheikha said. ""Neighborhood by neighborhood we have actually gone into our cities and mapped every building, every villa, and every shopping mall in order to provide an accurate location for pickups and dropoffs."" Read more: Careem has mapped 45,000 miles of road in its bid to compete on a global stage Cash is still king in the Middle East, but simply accepting hard currency in exchange for rides is more complicated than it might seem. ""Cash might seem like a simple option in the app, but to enable it at scale required a lot of work,"" Sheikha explained. The company assigns credit limits to captains (its term for drivers on the platform) based on their driving history on the platform. Those limits decide how much cash one driver can collect before having to deposit the company's cut. Careem's algorithm can then prioritize credit card trips to let the accounting work out for commissions. Drivers can also arrange a rendezvous to move cash, in a move that could foreshadow Careem's plans to enter the payments and remittances space, a huge industry in the region. Given Careem's experience pioneering ride-hailing in the region, it makes sense why Uber would want to buy out the competition rather than try to compete. ""For a global player to come in and start providing a service to the top 2% to 3% of the population is not difficult, they're used to the convenience,"" Sheikha said. ""But as soon as you start going down the masses, you require a lot of tailoring."" For example, ""it took Uber almost 2 years to realize that very few people in this region have a credit card,"" he said. ""That's a very basic thing. It's 101 in this region."" Uber, for it's part, seemed to recognize that as well. In an email to Uber employees late Wednesday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Sheikha and his co-founder are ""first-class entrepreneurs"" with a truly extraordinary product. ""ver time, by integrating parts of our networks, we can operate more efficiently, achieve even lower wait times, expand new products like high-capacity vehicles and payments, and quicken the already remarkable pace of innovation in the region"" he said of the acquisition. ""It's a great day for the Middle East, for the region's thriving tech sector, for Careem, and for Uber.""  This is a subscriber-only story.

JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images           The House of Representatives failed to garner enough votes to override President Donald Trump's veto of the resolution crafted to terminate his national emergency declaration . A veto override would have required a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate to reverse Trump's decision. Trump's national emergency declaration is also facing several lawsuits. WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives failed to garner enough votes to override President Donald Trump's veto of the resolution crafted to terminate his national emergency declaration to divert military funds and build a wall along the United States border with Mexico. The vote finished 248-181, far short of the required two-thirds majority required to overturn a presidential veto. Read more : Americans overwhelmingly want Congress to defy Trump and override his veto of the resolution to end his border-wall emergency declaration The inability of Congress to override Trump's veto from earlier this month means that, for the time being, the national emergency declaration will go on as the White House has planned. The Senate passed the resolution, 59-41 , with 12 Republicans joining a unanimous conference of Democrats, issuing an embarrassment to Trump, whose administration attempted to quell the rebellion brewing in the lead-up to the vote. That vote came after the House passed the same resolution in February , when 13 Republicans crossed the aisle. The House's failure to override the veto come after an INSIDER poll showing that almost twice as many Americans supported Congress' effort to reject the president. But the emergency declaration is not exactly settled because it still faces a host of lawsuits , including one from a coalition of nearly two-dozen states led by California. Read more: THE OTHER BORDER 'CRISIS': While America is fixated on Mexico and the wall, thousands of migrants are fleeing for Canada in a dramatically different scene The multi-state lawsuit challenging the emergency declaration argues that money appropriated to their respective states could be at risk as a result of the White House's decision to reprogram certain funds. When the lawsuit was announced, Trump went on Twitter to rail against it as a plot created by the ""Radical Left."" ""As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit!"" Trump wrote on Twitter .

The deal was signed Monday as Chinese President Xi Jinping visited France’s Emmanuel Macron in Paris. No value was announced, but the pre-discount list price for the order is roughly $35 billion . Airbus’s shares rose more than 2% on the news.  “We are honored to support the growth of China’s civil aviation with our leading aircraft families–single-aisle and widebodies,” said Airbus commercial aircraft chief Guillaume Faury, who will become CEO next month. “Our expanding footprint in China demonstrates our lasting confidence in the Chinese market and our long-term commitment to China and our partners.”  Almost all the planes—290 of the 300—are in Airbus’s single-aisle A320 family. This is the line with which Boeing was scrambling to compete when it developed its 737 Max 8 aircraft, which have been grounded around the world in the wake of two deadly crashes. Boeing’s planes are still parked while the company readies a software fix for the automated flight control issue that may have caused the accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia.    China was among the first countries to order the Max 8’s grounding, and it is reportedly considering cutting new 737 Max planes from the list of American products it would buy under a trade deal with the U.S.  The value of the French deal also provides some interesting perspective regarding Italy’s recent Belt and Road agreement with China, struck as Xi visited Rome a couple days ago. Belt and Road is China’s attempt to create a successor to the Silk Road trade routes of old, but critics see it as a tool of expansionism. This past weekend, Italy became the first G7 country to sign up.  The export-driven Italian agreement was worth less than $3 billion—though the Italian government claims it could end up being worth over $22 billion—and it leaves Italy open to criticism from other Western European countries that it will become overly dependent on China.   Macron, a big Belt and Road critic, turned his reception of Xi into a show of European unity by inviting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to join in on Tuesday talks. “Europe must be united and have a coherent message. That’s what we are doing on strategic investments,” he said in a joint address with his Chinese counterpart.  In total, China and France agreed deals with a value of around $45 billion, covering areas such as shipping, banking and renewable energy—and all outside the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.

The 248-181 vote, which didn’t clear the two-thirds threshold, was the coda of a long struggle over funding a wall along the border with Mexico. Both the Democratic-led House and GOP-controlled Senate had previously passed a resolution rejecting Mr. Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the southern border, prompting him to issue his first veto earlier...

Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. American Express/Instagram If you have the Platinum Card® from American Express , you can automatically get Gold elite status in the Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors loyalty program without having to stay a certain number of nights. Even if you stay in hotels just five or six nights a year, the perks that come with Gold status can be particularly valuable, ranging from extra points to free breakfast. Read on to see the benefits you can get. The US version American Express Platinum Card offers a tremendous amount of value for cardholders , despite a large $550 annual fee. For instance, during my first year with the card, I got more than $2,000 in value , netting me more than three times the value of the annual fee. In addition to perks like airport-lounge access and travel credits, one big benefit of the Platinum Card is that just by holding it you're eligible for complimentary mid-tier elite status in the Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors hotel loyalty programs. Without the Platinum Card , you'd generally need to spend at least 25 nights in Marriott hotels to earn Gold status in the Bonvoy, or a whopping 40 nights (or 20 stays) in Hilton hotels to earn Hilton Honors Gold. While the benefits of elite status are obviously more useful the more you use them — so the more often you stay in hotels — the status you get from the Platinum Card can still be worthwhile even if you just spend five or so nights in hotels each year. Just make sure to link your card to your loyalty accounts to activate the status. While both hotel statuses are called Gold, there are actually some pretty big differences between the benefits that this level of status comes with at each brand. Keep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make the Platinum Card a great option, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards — plus, the Platinum Card is a charge card, meaning you have to pay the balance off in full each month. When you're working to earn credit-card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card . Marriott Bonvoy Marriott Bonvoy Gold status includes many valuable perks. Marriott As part of Marriott's merger with Starwood, the two brands' separate loyalty programs were brought under a unified set of benefits in August, and were officially combined this winter. With the unified program came revised benefits for each status level. Here's what you can get with Marriott Bonvoy Gold status from your Platinum Card (keep in mind that you'll have to book directly with the hotel to get your elite benefits, not through a third-party site). You can also get complimentary Gold status from the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant™ American Express® Card . 25% bonus points on each stay This is fairly self-explanatory. You'll get a 25% bonus on every point you earn during your stay — this includes the points you earn on your room, plus the ones you earn when you charge incidentals to your room, such as the hotel restaurant or spa services. Room upgrades This benefit is pretty self-explanatory too. When you check in, you'll get an upgraded room type as long as there's availability. This can mean you get more space, a better view, or some other improvement. Late checkout As long as there's availability in the hotel, you can get a checkout time as late as 2 p.m. as a Gold elite member. Just make sure to request it at the front desk. Welcome gift When you check in for your stay, you'll get 250 to 500 bonus points as a thank you. It's not huge, but it's a nice way to help pad your points balance. Complimentary premium internet access in the room This one can be especially useful. When you have Gold status and log into the hotel's in-room WiFi network, you'll get the enhanced-speed option at no charge. Hilton Honors Hilton’s Waldorf Astoria luxury brand took over operation of the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas in August. Hilton Hilton Honors as a reward program has undergone some changes over the past few years, but generally I find it to be a useful program. Its Gold level comes with a handful of extremely valuable perks, of which I'm definitely a fan. Keep in mind you can also get complimentary Gold status with the Hilton Honors Ascend Card, or Diamond status with the Aspire Card . Here's what you get: 80% bonus points While Hilton points are generally worth a bit less than Marriott points — though not by that much anymore — Hilton makes up for this and more with a higher bonus on your earned points. Like with Marriott Bonvoy, this includes just about every room charge. Free breakfast This is a big one — enough that I often lean toward staying at Hilton hotels more than Marriott ones Hotel breakfasts can be expensive, but sometimes it's the best option — especially if you want to maximize your vacation time. As a Gold member, you and a travel companion who's in the same room as you can get a free breakfast every morning. The savings from this can add up quickly, especially since the continental-breakfast buffet can be $20 or more per person. Late checkout The details on this benefit are a bit ambiguous, but as a Hilton Honors Gold member, you can get a late checkout time on request, subject to availability. Fifth reward night free Anytime you book a four-night stay using points, you can stay for a fifth night for free. Obviously this can be an excellent benefit if you're saving up points for a vacation — you'll have enough for your stay sooner. Two free bottles of water There's nothing quite as frustrating as checking into your room, tired and thirsty after a long flight or drive, and grabbing a water bottle waiting for you on your nightstand only to realize it's a wildly inflated hotel-minibar price. If you're a Gold elite member, there's nothing to worry about — two water bottles are free. Room upgrade You'll get a room upgrade when you check in if it's available. While this generally excludes executive suites, some hotels will give you a top upgrade anyway. Keep in mind that you may need to ask for the upgrade.

Yet that is what Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, did on March 13th. Ecuador joined six other countries who have withdrawn from the South American Union (Unasur), a talking shop which once included all 12 of the continent’s nations, criticising it for the “perverse politicking of the self-styled 21st-century socialists”. For good measure he said he wants his country to repossess Unasur’s gleaming, cantilevered $65m headquarters near Quito, opened in 2014 and paid for by his predecessor, Rafael Correa, calling it “an ode to waste”. He wants to turn it into a university for indigenous people. Mr Moreno is among several South American presidents who may go to Santiago on March 22nd to launch a replacement for Unasur called Prosur. This is a brainchild of Iván Duque, Colombia’s new conservative president, and his Chilean counterpart, Sebastián Piñera, of the centre-right. Unveiling the idea in January, Mr Duque said that rather than a bureaucratic organisation, Prosur will be a “co-ordination mechanism” supporting democracy and the market economy. Mr Piñera has invited all but one of the 12 countries. The exception is Venezuela. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Prosur is a sign of the changing political climate in South America. After a period of hegemony for the left, of various strands, the region has swung to the right in recent elections. Yet, far from being an answer to regional disunity, Prosur looks like a restatement of the problem: that in Latin America regional institutions have become hostage to ideology and ephemeral political alignments. They rarely work to forward the co-operation that would be in the lasting interest of all their members. It was precisely these faults that doomed Unasur, a good idea traduced by misguided political leadership. Its origins lay in a Brazilian wish to talk about cross-border transport and energy projects. By the time it was formally constituted by treaty in 2008, those practical aims had succumbed to the overlapping ambitions of two leftist presidents, Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, to create a body devoted to political solidarity and defence co-operation, implicitly against the United States. Unasur’s last secretary-general, Ernesto Samper, a former Colombian president, told Bello in 2015 that the body was the reflection of “a political scenario” in which most governments were of the left. Its commitment to democracy in the region, he said, was to “the real validity of social rights”—a formula that echoed Cuban and Venezuelan propaganda. Venezuela’s opposition and its many supporters came to see Mr Samper as a stooge for the Venezuelan government. When Mr Samper’s term ended, a broad coalition of countries proposed José Octavio Bordón, a shrewd centrist politician and diplomat from Argentina, as his replacement. Venezuela vetoed him. That was the final straw. Unasur’s fate is a symbol of the deep fracture caused by Venezuela’s regime and its remaining friends in South America. It is also a rebuke to Brazilian foreign policy under Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Yet walking away from Unasur rather than trying to bypass Venezuela and reform the organisation looks like a mistake. “You don’t overcome the fracture by setting up a new organisation composed only of your friends,” says a former South American foreign minister, who worries about the “improvisation” it embodies. Many South American officials who have no sympathy for chavista Venezuela are cool towards Prosur. Several countries may stay away. Pressing Venezuela to return to democracy is a task that the region has entrusted to the Lima group, an ad hoc body of 14 countries that works reasonably well. That it includes Canada is hardly an existential problem. And as described by its founders, Prosur will lack the heft to do the job Unasur should have done (but didn’t) of working for practical measures of integration—especially by acting as a bridge between the two economic blocs in South America, Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance. As for Unasur, it may not actually die, but join Latin America’s clutter of the moribund. Laurence Whitehead of Oxford University has written that the penchant of Latin America’s elites for the latest ideological fashion has turned the region into a “mauseolum of modernities”. That now applies to its institutions of integration. This penchant is a luxury that a region which is falling behind economically cannot afford.

He took traditional instruments and pushed them towards abstraction, detuning guitars and rattling timpani; his influence can be felt in the music of David Bowie, Nick Cave and Pulp. In “30 Century Man” (2006), a documentary about Mr Walker’s songwriting, Brian Eno described the music as “humiliating”. “We haven’t got any further than this,” he laughed. “It’s a disgrace, really.” Mr Walker, born Noel Scott Engel in Ohio in 1943, rose to fame in the 1960s as part of the Walker Brothers, a crooning vocal group (they were not in fact related). After a stint as the bass guitarist—he had worked as a session musician on the Sunset Strip as a teenager—he became the band’s lead vocalist. His melancholy baritone on “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine (Anymore)” and “Make It Easy On Yourself” helped to turn the group into teen idols, particularly in Britain. The band offered an alternative to Beatlemania, recording ballads by Burt Bacharach, Bob Dylan and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, as well as standards such as “Summertime” and “Land of 1000 Dances”. When the group began to release original tunes as B-sides in order to make money on royalties, Mr Walker offered moody character sketches including “Orpheus”, a track about an affair with a married woman, and “Genevieve”. The group officially disbanded in 1968. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Freed from the constraints of commercial pop music but still considered a bankable star, Mr Walker made a quartet of solo albums. They included baroque pop, covers and ballads, but also showcased his innovative ideas. With “The Amorphous Humphrey Plugg”, “Plastic Palace People” and “Big Louise” he transformed the pop song by making it epic in scale, inhabited by vivid, bizarre characters. Obsessed with European film—one song, “The Seventh Seal”, was a nod to Ingmar Bergman—and British kitchen-sink drama, Mr Walker reflected on disease, death and existentialism. He recorded songs by Jacques Brel, rendering them in cinematic orchestral arrangements. “Scott” (1967), “Scott 2” (1968), “Scott 3” (1969) were hits with both critics and audiences. He was so popular that the BBC gave him his own television series. By the time “Scott 4” was released in 1969, though, Mr Walker had tuned out the crowd-pleasing ballads and amped up the weirdness. Many listeners moved on to rock. Mr Walker retreated for most of the 1970s, recording substandard covers on mediocre albums, perhaps to meet contractual obligations, and reuniting with the Walker Brothers for a string of unremarkable soft-rock records. But “Nite Flights” (1978), the band’s avant-garde swansong, reignited his ambition. He wrote four tracks for the album, and returned to solo work with “Climate of the Hunter” (1984). A number of records followed, increasingly adventurous in form and lyrical content. The seminal “Tilt” (1995) featured “Farmer in the City”, a haunting song envisioning the real-life murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini, an Italian poet and film director. “The Drift” (2006) explored similarly grim subject matter with songs such as “Cossacks Are” and “Clara”, a track inspired by the newsreel footage of Mussolini’s death that had haunted Mr Walker since his youth. Mr Walker’s output was visionary, re-evaluating sounds as well as the song form. He worked slowly and devotedly, challenging his musicians to avoid practising or even knowing the melodies; he tasked producers with finding the sound of braying donkeys, or of raw meat being punched, to create an original soundscape. He found inspiration in strange and dark corners, and his genius was to wrest an unruly beauty from those nightmares. Next The daring and drama of Tintoretto Prospero Mar 26th 2019 by J.D.

Smollett had been charged with 16 different criminal counts after being accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack against him. Officials on Feb. 21 said he both faked a letter using racist and homophobic language, mailing it to the Chicago studio where Empire is filmed, and paid $3,500 to two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. Police said Smollett staged the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary .    He pleaded not guilty to the charges.  An unscheduled emergency hearing was held Tuesday morning, before the charges were dropped. The judge also granted a motion to seal the case.  The sealing of the case by the judge will likely only add to the mystery surrounding the events. Smollett’s attorney, Patricia Brown Holmes, said the actor did not reach a deal with prosecutors. However, he did agree to forfeit his $100,000 bond “so he could go on with his life and get this over with.” In doing so, it essentially means Smollett surrendered $10,000 (the 10% of the bond he personally posted) that normally would be returned to him.  “Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions,” Smollett’s attorneys said in a statement. “This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is wrong. It is a reminder that a victim, in this case Jussie, deserves dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result. Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and career.”   Smollett has said he was attacked when he went to buy food late at night in downtown Chicago, adding that one attacker told him “this is MAGA country”. Initially, he received a wave of support, but suspicions began to grow when police could find no video footage of the attack.  After he was charged, Fox removed Smollett from the final episodes of Empire ‘s fifth season, saying “Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out.”  The network has not commented further on his future on the show.

The case against Purdue and other manufacturers was scheduled to go to trial in May. Accusations against the Stamford, Connecticut-based company included downplaying the addiction risk of opioids while overstating the benefits.  The company previously denied any wrongdoing, saying labels for its painkiller carried warnings about the risk of abuse and misuse associated with the drugs.   At a news conference Tuesday confirming the settlement, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said he intends to ""hold accountable other defendants ... for their role in creating the worst public health crisis in our state and nation we've ever seen.""  The settlement is just ""the first step,"" he added.  As a part of the agreement, unveiled Tuesday, Purdue will contribute $102.5 million to fund the creation of a National Center for Addiction Studies at Oklahoma State University. The company will also donate $20 million worth of medicines to support the center's treatment mission.  The agreement, which resolves all of the state's claims against Purdue, also includes an additional payment of $72.5 million, of which $12.5 million will be available to counties and cities in the state to abate the effects of the opioid crisis, the company said.  The Sacklers, who were not named as defendants in the lawsuit, will contribute $75 million toward the university center as well, Purdue added.  ""Purdue is very pleased to have reached an agreement with Oklahoma that will help those who are battling addiction now and in the future,"" Purdue Pharma CEO Craig Landau said in a statement. ""We applaud Attorney General Mike Hunter for his leadership in making such an agreement possible.""  OxyContin is a prescription drug used to treat moderate to severe pain in adults. From 1999 to 2017, nearly 218,000 people have died in the United States from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. OxyContin first came on the market in 1996.  The settlement Tuesday may take some pressure off Purdue, which has been considering bankruptcy protection.  Earlier this month, Landau said the company was considering bankruptcy to protect its assets against thousands of lawsuits for its alleged role in the opioid epidemic. Purdue was founded in the 1950s by brothers Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler.  --AP contributed to this report.

Multiple private equity firms have considered, but opted against, buying Bed, Bath, people said. At least one prominent activist investor has looked at and passed on pushing for change at Bed, Bath, a person familiar said.      Lauren Hirsch   Published 2 Hours Ago  Updated  1 Hour Ago  CNBC.com              Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Shoppers walk past a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Washington, D.C.   A well-known company in the beaten up retail sector with shares that have fallen nearly 80 percent since an all-time high in 2015 should be bait for activist investors. It's the ideal duo of the sex appeal of a recognizable name and affordability granted by an out-of-favor industry.   But for Bed, Bath & Beyond , the hunter ended up being three little-known activist investors who, combined, cobbled up less than 5 percent stake. Investors Legion Partners Asset Management, Macellum Advisors and Ancora Advisors on Tuesday confirmed their stake in the retailer and list of demands. They want a full turnover of the retailer's board and for it to consider the sale of some of its smaller brands.  Legion's other recent campaigns include settlements with cloud communications provider Vonage Holdings , Playtex-owner Edgewell Personal Care and weight loss program Nutrisystem.   The under-the-radar investors, and limited size of their bets, indicates the unclear path to salvation Bed, Bath currently has in its reach.  Its industry challenges are significant. Nearly every product the company sells, from linens to towels to cookware can be found online. Almost nothing is branded unique to the retailer, meaning nothing is proprietary. It has a nearly 1,000-store footprint, but analysts have dinged many as cluttered and dirty.  A sale to a private equity firm would be difficult to finance.  Bed, Bath shares have a market value of $2.37 billion, after Tuesday's gains. A trail of bankrupt leveraged buyouts from Toys R Us to Gymboree has made both lenders and buyers nearly allergic when it comes to retail. Those challenges were most recently highlighted when struggling video game retailer Gamestop called off its own sale process earlier this year. Its market value is about half of Bed, Bath's, at $1.05 billion.  Multiple private equity firms having considered acquisitions of Bed, Bath over the past few years, people tell CNBC, but no deal has transpired. In 2015, private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners built a stake in the company, a toehold that did not ultimately lead to a deal, despite some investor expectations that it would. The company's stock has steadily declined as expectations of a sale have waned. Over the past year, shares have fallen 19 percent, including Tuesday's stock pop.  Meantime, selling some of Bed Bath's pieces, like Buy Buy Baby, which sells baby gear like cribs and strollers, and Cost Plus World Market, which sells discount home decor and gift items, is also difficult. The retail units work together, giving them stronger purchasing power with its suppliers. Breaking the businesses apart risks reducing some of that leverage.  The retailer also does not break out the units' performances in their annual filings, making it difficult to know how well they are performing.  As result of these challenges, at least one prominent activist investor has looked at and passed on pushing for change at Bed, Bath, a person familiar said.  Still, the three activist firms have pounced loudly. They are pushing for the rare turnover of the entirety of Bed, Bath's board. Its slate includes executives who have presided over similarly challenged retailers such as Alexander Smith, who served as CEO of home furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports from February 2007 until December 2016.  While at Pier 1, Smith improved the company's gross margins by 1,200 basis points in the five years between 2007 and 2012. Still shares of the company rose by only 26 percent while he was CEO, compared to the S&P 500 , which grew 54.8 percent. The retailer is currently working with law firm Kirkland & Ellis on restructuring advice, a person familiar tells CNBC. Kirkland's role with Pier 1 was first reported by Reuters.  Other nominees include Janet Grover, the former corporate vice chairman of Macy's; Victor Herrero Amigo, the former CEO of Guess and John Fleming, the former head of global e-commerce at Uniqlo.  Same-store sales have declined for the past seven quarters, and some analysts say there is a case to be made that the company has been mismanaged. The average director tenure is approximately 19 years, according to the activists. Analysts have called management's lack of transparency, like its limited approach to breaking out financials, ""irritating.""  The activists called out what they say is ""excessive executive compensation"" despite ""chronic underperformance."" From fiscal 2015 to 2017, CEO Steven Temares received $51 million in awarded compensation related to performance despite a 70 percent decline in the company's stock, they say.  The retailer has been slow to keep pace with the evolution in the industry. While Amazon and Walmart have been investing in e-commerce for years, Bed, Bath only began to make all of its merchandise online within the past few years.  In an email to its employees Tuesday obtained by CNBC, Bed, Bath CEO Temares highlighted the company's planned and completed initiatives to usher in its turnaround. They include data-driven personalized marketing, improved merchandise and a new, more efficient operating structure in its buying group. Bed, Bath plans to roll out roughly 40 ""working labs"" where it is testing various initiatives, like different assortments and product layouts. It is actively evaluating its store leases.  It is also focusing on profitability rather than sales growth by changing ""free shipping"" requirements and eliminating its less profitable goods. The company this past quarter reported earnings of 18 cents per share . It has said it expects fiscal 2019 earnings per share will be about the same fiscal 2018.  ""In fiscal year 2019, our transformation will become even more visible to our customers,"" Temares wrote.  —CNBC's   Tom Franck   contributed to this report           Lauren Hirsch Retail Reporter for CNBC.com    Related Securities      Symbol  Price    Change  %Change      WMT   ---      AMZN   ---      S&P 500   ---      PIR   ---      GME   ---      BBBY   ---      EPC   ---      VG   ---                                            html Subscribe to CNBC PRO Licensing & Reprints Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Advertise With Us Closed Captioning Digital Products Terms of Service Privacy Policy News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC AdChoices Site Map Podcasts Contact Careers Help News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

Not those done by Margrethe Vestager. The European Union’s competition chief says she mostly looks stuff up on Qwant, which prides itself on not tracking users in the manner its larger rival does. Forget also Google Maps, or Gmail, or any other product from the Alphabet stable: “I have better alternatives that provide me with more privacy,” the Danish politician recently told a crowd at SXSW , an annual festival of tech, music and thought in Austin, Texas. Ms Vestager is hardly at the vanguard of a movement: even in its domestic French market, Qwant has less than 1% market share. Nor, at first, might her focus on privacy seem linked to her trustbusting brief. But, as she has explained, popular services like Facebook use their customers as part of the “production machinery”. You may not pay in cash to like a friend’s pictures, or every time you ask Alexa what a “cup” of butter is in grams—but you might as well do, given how much personal data you have to fork over. Rather melodramatically, Ms Vestager says what seem to be free services are ones for which you “pay with your life”.

Those appointed, by governments or themselves, to worry about competition have a strong interest in big tech firms such as Google and its parent Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. How could they not, given how quickly those firms have come to dominate the business landscape. On both sides of the Atlantic, the reputation that big-tech companies other than Apple have for making free with people’s data has led to rules being tightened, and there is talk of tightening them more. There are other concerns, too. Europeans have a fairly strong feeling that the firms do not pay enough tax. Everywhere there are worries about the content which they spread—such as, for a while, video of the massacre in Christchurch—and that which they are thought to suppress. Tech groups have hordes of lobbyists experienced in weathering these various issues. Occasional losses—such as the €1.5bn ($1.7bn) that Google was fined on March 20th for abusing its clout in the online-advertising market—can to some extent just be treated as a cost of doing business. What they are not so well prepared for is the crossing of some of these streams of complaint. European regulators are bringing together concerns about privacy and rules about competition to create constraints that could up-end the way companies do business online. Common market power Campaigners have long lamented that, although the users of online platforms tell pollsters that they care about privacy, they do not act as if they do. If privacy becomes tied to antitrust concerns, though, users do not need to care. They merely need to be content that regulators armed with big sticks—European regulators are empowered to levy fines on companies operating in Europe that are a significant fraction of their global revenue—should care on their behalf. Ms Vestager and her colleagues seem happy to do the honours. The premise for bringing together concerns about privacy and competition is that the tight grip which big tech companies have over user data is what has turned them into entrenched, and perhaps abusive, incumbents. As Andreas Mundt, head of Germany’s competition watchdog, the Bundeskartellamt, puts it, “Europe says…that data can provide market power.” In February, his agency startled technology companies and those who analyse them with a ruling against Facebook built on such an analysis. In a 300-page finding it argued that Facebook was only able to gather so much data because of its dominant position amid social networks. The measure of market power usually used to justify action on competition grounds is, roughly speaking, that a company is able to raise prices without losing customers. Such an ability suggests that the level of competition in the market needs at least looking into, and perhaps redressing. Facebook, being free to its public users (though not to the advertisers who buy the users’ attention), cannot have its market power analysed in this way. But Mr Mundt says that the company’s ability to encroach ever more on its users’ privacy without seeing them leave—for example, by starting to track them while they browse sites not connected to Facebook—is also a measure of market power. This analysis is leading to strict new rules on the amount of data Facebook can collect from German users. It can no longer mesh together the data it gathers from its various services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as it has said it wants to do. There are also restrictions on how much it can track its users when they browse the internet beyond Facebook. Mr Mundt compares these new constraints on the flow of information inside the company to Facebook being “internally broken up”. The logical step beyond limiting the accrual of data is demanding their disbursement. If tech companies are dominant by virtue of their data troves, competition authorities working with privacy regulators may feel justified in demanding they share those data, either with the people who generate them or with other companies in the market. That could whittle away a big chunk of what makes big tech so valuable, both because Europe is a large market, and because regulators elsewhere may see Europe’s actions as a model to copy. It could also open up new paths to innovation. Europe is not an impressive performer when it comes to creating tech behemoths. It is as well represented among big global tech companies as companies other than Google are in search-engine statistics: there is just one ( SA P , a business software company) in the top 20. Look at the top 200 internet companies and things are, if anything, a touch worse; just eight. But in regulatory heft the EU punches far above its members’ business weight. There are various ways of explaining this. One is that Europe’s keenness to regulate stops its tech firms from growing in the way that hands-off America encourages. Another is that the rigours of its zealous regulation are experienced, in the main, only by foreigners—which makes them more palatable to, or even popular with, politicians and the public. “Would Brussels be so tough on big tech companies if they were French or German?” asks one American executive, rhetorically. There is also the consideration that the companies potentially “disrupted” by internet innovators include European carmakers, telecoms companies and media groups, about whom European politicians care a lot. New copyright regulations being voted on by the European Parliament next week have been widely criticised for putting the interests of copyright holders, which largely means media companies, far ahead of the interests of online companies and, indeed, the free expression of users. Regardless of motive, though, this is now the way of the world. A look at the annual reports of big tech companies clearly shows that they have a lot of European issues to face, including taxes (see chart 1). And this means that differences between the ways in which Europeans and Americans think about competition and privacy matter a lot. Brussels rules Take competition first. Much of the underlying law governing cartels, mergers and competition is quite similar on both sides of the Atlantic. But the continents’ approaches to handling big companies are leagues apart. In recent decades, American antitrust policy has been dominated by free-marketeers of the so-called Chicago School, deeply sceptical of the government’s role in any but the most egregious cases. Dominant firms are frequently left unmolested in the belief they will soon lose their perch anyway: remember MySpace? The lure of fat profits is, after all, what motivates firms to innovate in the first place. While there is healthy academic debate over whether online businesses naturally, or even inevitably, have a tendency towards monopoly, it has yet to have much effect on regulation. American courts view dominant firms as a problem only if their position does clear harm to consumers. By contrast, “Europe is philosophically more sceptical of firms that have market power,” says Cristina Caffarra at Charles River Associates, an economics consultancy. Its regulators want to see competitors that have been less successful continue to exist, and even thrive. Competition is seen as valuable in and of itself, to ensure innovation happens beyond one firm that has conquered the market. “The debate on whether there has been underenforcement of antitrust is far more dynamic in Europe—there is a sense of urgency,” says Isabelle de Silva, head of France’s competition authority. Germany and Austria have changed laws to allow them to scrutinise takeovers of startups, in the belief tech incumbents are taking out future rivals before they have time to hatch into real competitors. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have together taken over a company per week for the past five years. There is not just more interest in regulating big tech in Europe; there is also more power to do so. William Kovacic, a former boss of the Federal Trade Commission in America, said recently that Brussels is “the capital of the world” for antitrust, leaving its American counterparts “in the shade”. American antitrust typically involves prosecuting the case in front of a judge. The European Commission can decide and impose fines by itself, without the approval of national governments, though the decisions are subject to appeal in the courts. And whereas, in America, only federal agencies can apply federal law, European antitrust law can be applied both by national authorities and the commission. Every major tech group has had run-ins with European antitrust rules. Since 2017, Google has been sanctioned three times, running up €8.2bn in fines for promoting its own shopping-comparison service in search results and edging out rivals with its Android phone software, as well as for abusing its strength in advertising. It is appealing the decisions. In 2017 Facebook was fined €110m for misinforming the EU about its plans for integrating WhatsApp with its flagship social network. In the same year Amazon was rebuked for the way it sold e-books, agreeing to change its practices. It is now under an early-stage investigation both in Germany and Europe-wide for the way it uses sales data from its “Marketplace” platform to compete with the independent retailers who sell through it. On March 13th Spotify, a Swedish music-streaming service, demanded that the commission step in to stop Apple levying hefty fees from those who sell services through its App Store. Then there is privacy. In the past century almost all European countries have experienced dictatorship, either home-grown or imposed through occupation, which has raised sensitivities. “Privacy is a fundamental right at EU level, in a way that it is not in America,” says Andrea Renda of the Centre for European Policy Studies, a think-tank. That right is enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in the same way that free speech is protected by America’s constitution. Polls show Europeans, and particularly Germans, to be more concerned about the use of their personal data by private companies than Americans are. When American tech companies first encountered these concerns they were relatively trifling. In 2010 German authorities demanded Google blur the homes of anyone who objected to appearing in its Street View service. (Rural Germany remains one of the last places where well-off people live beyond the service’s coverage.) Four years later, an EU -wide “right to be forgotten” provided some circumstances in which citizens could expunge stories about them from search results. The General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which came into force last May, raised the issue to a new level. Beyond harmonising data protection across Europe, it also established a principle that individuals should be able to choose how the information about them is used. This is an issue not just for the companies which currently dominate the online world—the provisions of the GDPR were central to the German ruling on Facebook—but also for that world’s basic business model. The data about their users collected by apps and browsers is the bedrock of online advertising—a business which in 2018 was worth $108bn in America according to eMarketer, a consultancy. The most valuable part of the industry works by selling the user’s attention to the highest bidder, a simple-sounding proposition which requires a labyrinthine and potentially leaky “adtech” infrastructure. Enterprises called “supply-side platforms” use data from apps and from cookies in browsers to pass a profile of every person who visits an advertising-supported page to an advertising exchange. There the rights to show adverts are auctioned off user by user. Bidders use the data from the supply-side, along with further data procured from brokers, to decide how likely the user is to act on their ad, and thus how much it is worth to show it to him. The highest bidder gets to put its ad on the user’s screen (see chart 2). Meanwhile, data associated with the transaction are used to update the brokers’ records. The more pertinent data the bidders get, the more the winning advertiser is likely to bid. This builds in incentives to get as much data to as many bidders as feasible. And that is not particularly conducive to the protection of privacy. The introduction of the GDPR spurred legal challenges to this system across Europe (see article ). Some decisions are already headed to appeal, and it seems sure that eventually at least a few will make it all the way up the tree to the European Court of Justice. The price of freedom Those cases will help determine the long-term impact of the GDPR . So will the degree to which other countries take up ideas like those of Mr Mundt, the German regulator. European regulators do not all see eye to eye on mingling privacy and antitrust, according to Alec Burnside of Dechert, a law firm. But he notes that there is something much closer to consensus on it than there would be in America. The way Ms Vestager talks about privacy seems quite in line with her German counterpart. Tech lobbyists in Brussels worry that Ms Vestager agrees with those who believe that their data empires make Google and its like natural monopolies, in that no one else can replicate Google’s knowledge of what users have searched for, or Amazon’s of what they have bought. She sent shivers through the business in January when she compared such companies to water and electricity utilities, which because of their irreproducible networks of pipes and power lines are stringently regulated. Sometimes the power of such networks gets them broken up: witness AT&T . Elizabeth Warren, a senator who wants to be the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 2020, has suggested Facebook and Google could also be split up. Ms Vestager pours cold water on the idea. But Europe’s privacy-plus-antitrust approach offers a halfway house: force the companies to share their data, thus weakening their market power and empowering the citizenry. In mid-March a panel appointed by the British government and led by Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was an adviser in Barack Obama’s White House, advocated such an approach, suggesting a regulator empowered to liberate data from firms to which it provided “strategic market status”. An EU panel with a similar remit is expected to issue recommendations along the same lines soon. The idea is for consumers to be able to move data about their Google searches, Amazon purchasing history or Uber rides to a rival service. So, for example, social-media users could post messages to Facebook from other platforms with approaches to privacy that they prefer. The innovative engineers of the tech incumbents would still have vast troves of data to work with. They could just no longer count on privileged access to them. The same principle might also lead to firms being able to demand anonymised bulk data from Google to strengthen rival search engines. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger of Oxford University points to precedent: large German insurers have to share data with smaller rivals to help them gauge risk. This may not be as fine a solution as it might sound. Getting lots of personal data to move freely while also keeping it safe is not straightforward. Users would be required to give serious thought to the question of with whom they wanted to share their information, as opposed to blindly clicking “Accept” buttons to get rid of pop-ups, as mostly happens today. Anonymising a large dataset—such as a compendium of Google searches which might then be used to train a rival’s algorithms—is harder than it might seem. Identifiable data about individuals can seep regardless. And there may not be much appetite for it. Following Britain’s lead, the EU has forced banks to allow their clients to move their data to third parties. But demand for services that let personal-finance apps look at your bank statements has yet to take off. Google and Facebook offer their users the possibility of downloading a portion of the data those users have provided to the firms (though those taking the offer up are best advised to have a large hard drive). But few rivals have invested in complementary systems that allow you to upload those data, suggesting that a lack of user data is not the factor limiting their ability to take on today’s incumbents. Still, the assumption remains that a combined focus on antitrust and privacy could, over time, both reduce the incumbents’ market power and open up new routes to competition. Enthusiasts point to IBM , faced with antitrust action, divorcing its software and hardware businesses in 1969. That created a new industry for software writers to explore. A world of social networks empowered to share aspects of Facebook’s map of who knows whom and likes what, while being free to explore business models other than advertising could produce all sorts of profitable, socially useful innovation by firms in Europe and around the world. And though Facebook might not do as well in such a future as it would if given free rein, it could still prosper. The past half-century has not been an irredeemably shabby one for IBM. Europe alone might not be able to bring all this about. But a mixture of the accommodations companies make to it and the example it sets to others could have a catalysing effect. The appearance of a European commissioner at SXSW is a rarity. Progressive American politicians were this year rarely a thumbdrive-throw away. They could have done worse than stop by and listen. Demanding that tech giants be broken up may get the odd rally chanting, but it would be hard to bring about. Calling on them to give power back to the people, though, has a certain ring to it.

S3studio Getty Images        By Emily Price  4:02 PM EDT       Citigroup is launching a new payments unit that will offer merchants consumer payment options such as credit cards, digital wallets, and direct bank account transfers.  Citigroup is reportedly partnering with payments firms including Mastercard for the new offering. Mastercard will provide some of the back-end connections and processing for merchants, The Wall Street Journal reports.  “Our mission is to power frictionless payment acceptance with nimble technology. We want to extend our leadership beyond the B2B payment space by developing capabilities to enable institutions to collect from consumers in a globally consistent and seamless fashion,” said Naveed Sultan, Global Head of Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions said in a prepared statement .  With the move, Citi says that institutions will be able to gain more visibility into the end-to-end transaction lifecycle, which will allow them to focus on their traditional business operations and growth. It says that consumers will benefit from payment ubiquity through a localized payment experience.    “Every institution wants to focus their time on providing their customers with the best experience or the best product. Our trusted technology helps them do just that. We are excited to work with Citi and their leading transaction services business,” Michael Miebach, Chief Product Officer, Mastercard said in Citi’s press release . “As they integrate Mastercard Payment Gateway Services, they’re making the whole process simpler for Citi’s institutional clients to accept payments from anywhere in the world and continue growing their businesses.”  The move is expected to allow Citigroup to better compete with companies such as PayPal and Stripe, which are typically preferred by some internet companies.

It is the largest known delta from Earth’s history and may have been a crucial habitat. During the Triassic period when dinosaurs first appeared, all of Earth’s continents were joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. Part of northern Pangaea is preserved under the Barents Sea between Norway and Russia. So Tore Grane Klausen, whilst at the University of Bergen in Norway, and his colleagues took data from drilling wells in the Barents Sea and combined it with seismic data to map the rock layers.   Advertisement        Read more: Going under: The world’s sinking cities  The team found preserved sediments from a delta that existed 237 to 227 million years ago. A delta is a wide, flat plain of muddy sediment that forms when a river meets a larger water body, like a lake or ocean. The remains spanned the entire Barents Sea and were 10 times the size of largest modern deltas in the Amazon and the Ganges. This equates to 1.65 million square kilometres, or about 1 per cent of the total modern land area. The team has not named the delta, but has informally called it the Snadd Delta because they found it in rocks called the Snadd Formation. Delta plain dinosaur stomp A delta forms when rivers carry sediments downstream then dump them by the coast. The accumulated sediments form vast, fertile plains that can support huge numbers of plants and animals . The ancient delta lay on the north coast of Pangaea. It was fed by multiple rivers flowing north from a mountain range, which supplied huge volumes of sediment. In turn, intense monsoon rains formed the rivers. The animals that would have lived in the delta have not been studied in detail, but they included amphibians called labyrinthodonts that often lived in wetlands. The plant life included lots of ferns and some conifers. “Everywhere you look, you can pick up these sandstone samples with imprints of ferns,” says Klausen. Just off the coast, crocodile-like pliosaurs and dolphin-like ichthyosaurs ruled the seas. Much of the rest of Pangaea was less hospitable. The regions close to the equator spent much of the Triassic as extremely hot and dry deserts , so the delta may have been a major centre of biodiversity. The delta was also long-lived, steadily growing for periods of 2 to 5 million years at a time. This suggests sea level did not change much, in line with the established idea that the Triassic had a steady “greenhouse” climate with little or no ice at the poles.

Any such death is one too many. It is encouraging to see ITV, Love Island ’s broadcaster, committing itself to providing access to psychological support before, during and after contestants appear on the show. Other broadcasters and production companies must make the same commitments. I also welcome UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s intervention , highlighting that reality TV shows have a duty of care for contestants. As someone who has been researching suicide for more than 20 years, the stark reality is that although we have made significant advances in understanding suicide, our ability to predict it is no better than chance. In part, this is because suicide is statistically a rare event. In the UK, for example, of every 100,000 people, 10 will die by their own hand in a given year . The difficulty is in trying to identify those people, but also identify when they are suicidal. The near-impossibility of this task is why keeping people safe, and mitigating suicide risk when people are vulnerable, is vital. Complex causes This means a duty of care not just for producers of reality TV shows, but the wider news media. We know that coverage of high-profile suicides can increase the risk of suicidal behaviour. But too often, that coverage fails to highlight the complexity of the contributing factors. Suicide rarely has a single cause. It is generally the product of a complex set of circumstances , often beginning with early life trauma, later mental health problems, fear of failure and a belief that loved ones would be better off if they were dead. When reporting such deaths, this complexity should be conveyed. In the UK, the charity Samaritans maintains guidelines on how to report celebrity suicides . The message is simple: avoid speculation about causes, don’t report explicit details about suicide methods and don’t offer simplistic explanations. Do offer messages of compassion, hope and recovery. These guidelines should be adhered to. This isn’t about censorship, but about keeping people alive. Suicidal thoughts wax and wane, and despite the unbearable pain, things can and do get better. Every life matters: we must work together to ensure that we protect everyone who is vulnerable, whatever degree of fame they achieve in life. Need a listening ear?

So say calculations on how deforestation will alter temperatures in the region over the next three decades.  Logging has been expanding in Brazil . And the election of populist Jair Bolsonaro as president in January has provoked fears that deforestation could get even worse if he appeases the powerful agribusiness lobby .

By  Rachel Becker    Mar 26, 2019,  9:10pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Why a New York county banned unvaccinated children from public spaces      share     tweet       Linkedin          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    A photo of a patient with a rash taken at a New York Hospital in 1958.  Photo by CDC via Getty Images     County officials in measles-wracked Rockland County, NY took the extraordinary step today of banning unvaccinated minors from entering public places. If vaccine-preventable diseases continue to flare up in pockets of unvaccinated people across the country, these types of bans might become the new normal.  The ban is part of the county’s efforts to curb the spread of measles, which has infected 153 people so far — mostly unvaccinated children under the age of 18. International visitors brought the virus to Rockland starting in September 2018 , and the virus spread. Since the Rockland outbreak started, nearly 17,000 people in the county have received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations, and unvaccinated children have been banned from local schools , according to a statement from the New York State Department of Health.  Progress on fighting the spread of measles has stalled, however, according to a Rockland County press briefing today. “As this outbreak has continued, our inspectors have begun to meet increasing resistance from those they’re trying to protect,” county executive Ed Day says in the briefing . Now, the county is taking the more drastic step of declaring a state of emergency that will ban unvaccinated children from all public places starting at midnight tonight.  “We’re not going to be asking for anyone’s vaccination records on the streets.”  The ban lifts in 30 days, or, for individual unvaccinated kids, it lifts when they get their first measles shot. Children who can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons are excluded from the ban altogether.  Officials won’t force teens to turn over their medical information, according to Rockland spokesperson John Lyon . “We’re not going to be asking for anyone’s vaccination records on the streets,” Lyon tells The Verge. Instead, the plan is to enforce the ban after the fact, Lyon says. If an epidemiological investigation turns up an unvaccinated minor in, say, a shopping mall, that kid’s parents could be charged with a misdemeanor and face a $500 fine or 90 days in jail, Lyon says.  Jailing people isn’t the goal, Day says: “This is not something we’re looking to do.” Instead, the goal is to raise awareness about the importance of vaccines in a county where measles has been spreading for the past six months, particularly among orthodox Jewish communities . “We’re doing it in such a way to just get attention at this point so that people understand the seriousness of what they are doing — and not doing,” he says.  “We’re already seeing that chilling factor of people not cooperating with us.”  Rockland County officials considered the risk that this ban might make people who are sick with measles reluctant to seek medical care, Lyon says. But they need people to work with doctors as the county tries to identify people who may have been exposed to measles. They hope that the threat of consequences will motivate parents to either get their children vaccinated, or at least get people to cooperate with public health investigators. He points to an infected individual who exposed people at a Target and who later stopped helping the investigators narrow down when the exposure might have happened. “We’re already seeing that chilling factor of people not cooperating with us,” Lyon says. “So from our perspective, this gives us more tools to get them to cooperate with our investigators.”  Curbing the spread of this dangerous virus could require using these drastic measures we’re seeing in Rockland more often, according to vaccine expert Peter Hotez , dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. In another outbreak, officials announced today that at least 18 people have been infected with measles in Oakland County, Michigan, WXYZ Detroit reports . “It may take extraordinary measures to stem the increase in the number of cases we’ve been seeing,” Hotez says. “Otherwise they’re not going to get their arms around it. It’s just going to continue to infect large cohorts of people.”  “It may take extraordinary measures to stem the increase”  Restricting movement can help prevent diseases from spreading during emergencies, according to Leila Barraza , an assistant professor at the University of Arizona’s Zuckerman College of Public Health. Quarantine laws can force people who have been exposed to stay in their homes. Isolation laws can make people who are sick stay isolated in places like hospitals, for example. And other social distancing laws can also make sure people aren’t congregating at places like schools, workplaces, or public events. “It’s a way to create a distance between people so they can’t spread disease,” Barraza says.  These laws have been upheld on a smaller scale in other cases. When Rockland County banned unvaccinated students from schools where fewer than 95 percent of the students were vaccinated, a group of parents sued the county health department. But earlier in March, a federal judge said the school ban could stay . “It really is to protect those individuals. Because if you’re unvaccinated for measles, you have a high chance of contracting measles if you’re exposed to it,” Barraza says.  Places like France and Italy have also instituted school bans. But Rockland’s new ban is different, Barraza says. “It’s a new, more expansive measure than just excluding unvaccinated students from schools,” she says. “I think that’s why it’s getting so much publicity.” And she could see this being the first of more, similar bans in the future. “I think this definitely could be a new trend as we have more unvaccinated children,” she says. “If there’s evidence this has worked, then I think it will probably be tried again.”  “This is a self-inflicted wound.”  Oscar Alleyne , chief of programs and services for the National Associations of County and City Health Officials, hopes that the spread of vaccine preventable diseases won’t get to that point. “I would hope that it is not the new normal because we know that we have a tool and a technique that can work, that has worked, that has saved lives.” He’s talking about vaccines, and he and Hotez agree that failing to use this tool is a consequence of the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. “It’s the new normal in America, now that measles seems to be coming back,” Hotez says. “This is a self-inflicted wound.”       Next Up In Science                         Most Read                  Apple announces Apple Card credit card  Coming summer 2019              Europe’s controversial overhaul of online copyright receives final approval  The much-criticized ‘upload filter’ and ‘link tax’ will soon become law in EU nations              The Apple Card is Apple’s thinnest and lightest status symbol ever  There was one hardware announcement at Apple’s services event                 Huawei’s P30 Pro is a photographic powerhouse with a tiny notch  Huge battery, absentee bezels, and a promising new quad-camera system              All the things Apple didn’t tell us about its streaming TV service  Apple TV Plus is more mysterious than familiar                        Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.    email address...

But that could soon change: The fast-food giant has embraced machine learning, in a fittingly super-sized way. McDonald’s is set to announce that it has reached an agreement to acquire Dynamic Yield, a startup based in Tel Aviv that provides retailers with algorithmically driven ""decision logic"" technology. When you add an item to an online shopping cart, it’s the tech that nudges you about what other customers bought as well. Dynamic Yield reportedly had been recently valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars; people familiar with the details of the McDonald’s offer put it at over $300 million. That would make it the company's largest purchase since it acquired Boston Market in 1999. The burger giant can certainly afford it; in 2018 alone it tallied nearly $6 billion of net income, and ended the year with a free cash flow of $4.2 billion. But that still doesn’t address the bigger question of why. For that, you have to head to the drive-thru. Drive Time McDonald’s serves around 68 million customers every single day. The majority of those people never get out of their car, opting instead to place and pick up their orders at the drive-thru window. And that’s where McDonald’s will deploy Dynamic Yield first. McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook McDonald's Over the last several years, you may have noticed that the displays as you approach the McDonald’s drive-through—and inside the restaurant, for that matter—have gone digital. That’s just one of several significant, data-focused investments that both McDonald’s and its franchisees have made since CEO Steve Easterbrook took the helm in 2015. The company also launched an app and partnered with Uber Eats in that time, in addition to making a number of infrastructure improvements . It even relocated its headquarters less than a year ago from the suburbs to Chicago’s vibrant West Town neighborhood, in a bid to attract young talent. Look at the Dynamic Yield acquisition, then, not as the start of a digital transformation, but as the catalyst that evolves it. “What we hadn’t done is begun to connect the technology together, and get the various pieces talking to each other,” says Easterbrook, in an exclusive interview with WIRED. “How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization? To do that, you’ve really got to unlock the data within that ecosystem in a way that’s useful to a customer.” Here’s what that looks like in practice: When you drive up to place your order at a McDonald’s today, a digital display greets you with a handful of banner items or promotions. As you inch up toward the ordering area, you eventually get to the full menu. Both of these, as currently implemented, are largely static, aside from the obvious changes like rotating in new offers, or switching over from breakfast to lunch. But in a pilot program at a McDonald’s restaurant in Miami, powered by Dynamic Yield, those displays have taken on new dexterity. Algorithms crunch data as diverse as the weather, time of day, local traffic, nearby events, and of course historical sales data, both at that specific franchise and around the world. In the new McDonald’s machine-learning paradigm, significant display real estate goes toward showing customers what other items have been popular at that location, and prompting them with potential upsells. Thanks for your Happy Meal order; maybe you’d like a Sprite to go with it. “We’ve never had an issue in this business with a lack of data,” says Easterbrook. “It’s drawing the insight and the intelligence out of it.” McDonald’s was reticent to share any specific insights gleaned so far, or numbers around the personalization engine’s effect on sales. But it’s not hard to imagine some of the possible scenarios. If someone orders two Happy Meals at 5 o’clock, for instance, that’s probably a parent ordering for their kids; highlight a coffee or snack for them, and they might decide to treat themselves to a pick-me-up. And as with any machine-learning system, the real benefits will likely come from the unexpected. “When you look at the answers that this decision engine provides, it may not seem so obvious to begin with, but for customers it makes sense. It’s not just about the individual, it’s also taking training information from other customers,” says Daniel Henry, McDonald’s executive vice president and global chief information officer. “It’s only going to get smarter and smarter, the more customers interact with it.” McDonald’s defines those customer benefits broadly. Multiple executives noted that if the drive-thru is moving slowly, the menu can dynamically switch to show items that are simpler to prepare, to help speed things up. Likewise, the display could highlight more complex sandwiches during a slower period. And as with any online checkout experience, it’s unlikely that the drive-thru window will tell you that you’ve actually ordered too much. While customer satisfaction may be the goal, the avenues McDonald’s takes to get there will increase revenues along the way. Think also beyond the store itself. A company that amasses as much data as McDonald’s will find no shortage of algorithmic avenues. “Ultimately you can see we’ll be able to use predictive analytics—we’re going to have real-time information, as we start to connect the kitchen together—further back through our supply chain. I’m sure that will happen,” says Easterbrook. “That isn’t part of this particular technology, but as you start to link the predictive nature of customer demand all the way through your stock levels in the restaurant and the kitchen, you can almost flex it back down through the supply chain."" He notes that McDonald’s is a high-volume, low-margin business; anything that helps cut down on waste makes a big difference. Joshua Lott/Bloomberg/Getty Images And given the scale at which it operates, any supply chain shifts at McDonald's tend to ripple throughout the entire food industry. Which gives you a sense of just how transformative this acquisition could be. Personal Touch As you might have guessed, McDonald’s didn’t spend over $300 million on a machine-learning company just to juice its drive-thru. Henry says he expects to see the technology in 1,000 locations within the next three months, eventually rolling out to the company’s 14,000 US restaurants and beyond. You can also expect McDonald’s to integrate its new machine-learning smarts not just broadly but deeply, albeit at a measured pace. “Like anything else, we’re going to see that this has a capability for in-store kiosks, it has a capability for kitchens, for mobile order and pay,” says Henry. “If we try to do that at once, we may lose focus. And we need to stay focused.” An important part of that focus is figuring out how to leverage the “personalization” part of a personalization engine. Fine-tuned insights at the store level are one thing, but Easterbrook envisions something even more granular. “If customers are willing to identify themselves—there’s all sorts of ways you can do that—we can be even more useful to them, because now we call up their favorites,” according to Easterbrook, who stresses that privacy is paramount. As for what form that might ultimately take, Easterbrook raises a handful of possibilities. McDonald’s already uses geofencing around its stores to know when a mobile app customer is approaching and prepare their order accordingly. Easterbrook suggests you could extend that, in a strictly opt-in capacity, to the smartphone itself, using a sort of beacon technology . Or, he says, license plate recognition could let the system identify a specific customer as they approach, and adjust the digital menu accordingly based on their purchase history. Consumer appetite for that sort of tracking remains to be seen, especially when awareness of the value and sensitivity of personal data has reached new heights. “We will be very sensitive as we learn, as we go forward,” says Easterbrook. “I think over time it’s going to be important to demonstrate that we can offer value back for customers willing to open themselves up to us.” High Yield And then there’s Dynamic Yield. Founded in 2011, the company has headquarters in New York as well as Tel Aviv, and a healthy roster of blue-chip retail clients, including Ikea, Sephora, and Urban Outfitters. It will remain independently run even after the acquisition, and plans to continue growing its business outside of the Golden Arches’ shadow. “We’re going to still stay scrappy,” says Dynamic Yield cofounder and CEO Liad Agmon. “I think that our customers will benefit from it in many ways. One is you remove the startup risk from the table. We don’t have to seek funding any longer, and we can focus on innovation. Also the risk of Dynamic Yield being swallowed into some legacy software play is out of the question.” McDonald’s vetted around 30 firms offering similar personalization engine services, and landed on Dynamic Yield after proving out the technology in the Miami pilot. “It’s probably less about the product and more about the data scientists that come with it, the people that come with it, and their ability to move quickly with us,” says Henry. Dynamic Yield essentially adds a personalization layer to the McDonald’s technology stack. The software that powers the display makes an API call with each order, and Dynamic Yield returns the results. That seamlessness has the added benefit of requiring little additional investment from McDonald’s franchisees to implement. The expensive part was the digital signs themselves. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence The prospect of taking on 68 million fast-food customers a day doesn’t bother Agmon, who notes that McDonald’s won’t put much stress on the system compared with the world of online shopping, which operates on a much larger scale in terms of both orders and items to sort through. The tie-up does, though, underscore just how blurred the lines between the physical and digital worlds have become. “If you think about how people shop a physical store and how they shop in an online store, they shop differently,” says Agmon. “But the same types of insights you get from the physical store you would apply to online. And the online store, with the data you get, you can apply it to different merchandizing in the physical store. I see it really as part of a continuum, and not as two separate experiences.” Which helps explain why McDonald’s has made a tech company by far its most substantial acquisition in two decades. You’ve seen decision logic at work every time you shop online; now it'll buttress your Extra Value Meal. “We’re a really straightforward business. People only come to us if they want something to eat, or something to drink,” says Easterbrook. “We’re not in the business of using technology to try to change people’s lives.” More Great WIRED Stories Airbnb’s “guerrilla war” against local governments Change your Facebook password right now With Stadia, Google's gaming dreams head for the cloud A more humane livestock industry, thanks to Crispr For gig workers, client interactions can get … weird 👀 Looking for the latest gadgets?

Megan Geuss - Mar 26, 2019 9:00 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Wind turbines spin as steam rises from the cooling towers of the Jäenschwalde coal-fired power plant. Sean Gallup/Getty Images     reader comments  46  with 31 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a report on Monday saying that in 2018, ""global energy-related CO 2 emissions rose by 1.7 percent to 33 Gigatonnes."" That's the most growth in emissions that the world has seen since 2013.  Coal use contributed to a third of the total increase, mostly from new coal-fired power plants in China and India. This is worrisome because new coal plants have a lifespan of roughly 50 years. But the consequences of climate change are already upon us, and coal's hefty emissions profile compared to other energy sources means that, globally, carbon mitigation is going to be a lot more difficult to tackle than it may look from here in the US.  Even in the US, carbon emissions grew by 3.1 percent in 2018, according to the IEA . (This closely tracks estimates by the Rhodium Group , which released a preliminary report in January saying that US carbon emissions increased by 3.4 percent in 2018.)  ""By country, China, the United States, and India together accounted for nearly 70 percent of the rise in energy demand,"" Reuters wrote .  74 percent of coal-fired power uneconomic in the US?  The numbers remind us that economics alone is likely not enough to rein in carbon emissions in the United States. Last week, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that barring some significant and unforeseeable changes, carbon emissions from the US are likely to stay about the same through 2050 .  This estimate takes into account big carbon-cutting measures that were already on the books in many states at the end of 2018, including California's pledge to meet 100 percent of its energy needs with carbon-free electricity. (It doesn't, however, take very recent policy decisions into account, like New Mexico's similar pledge that was signed in March.)  Energy Information Administration  The projections from the EIA assume that coal will be phased out aggressively, but despite that phaseout, the EIA expects 17 percent of the nation's energy mix to come from coal-fired power in 2050.  There is some hope that the EIA's projections are overly conservative. Analyst firm Vibrant Clean Energy (VCE) and nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation released a report (PDF) on Monday saying that 74 percent of coal-fired capacity in the US is uneconomic compared to new, local renewables. That is, the report compared the Marginal Cost of Energy (MCOE) of continuing to operate coal-fired power plants with the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of replacing that capacity with new wind or solar.  The result was that, megawatt-hour for megawatt-hour, brand-new renewable energy was cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants 74 percent of the time. By 2025, the researchers found that 85 percent of the US coal fleet was uneconomic compared to brand new renewable energy.           VCE / Energy Innovation             VCE / Energy Innovation        So why aren't coal-fired power plants facing more retirements if they're such a bad deal to keep running compared to newer, cleaner energy? Ultimately, the cost of running a coal-fired power plant is different from the price that the owner of that power plant gets paid, and in many markets, old power plants can keep making a profit on the rates that they collect. Utility Dive notes specifically that many coal plants in the Northeast benefit from selling power on the regional grid operator's capacity market , which is a market for energy companies to sell their electricity years ahead of time.  VCE and Energy Innovation admit that simply comparing MCOE of coal and LCOE of renewable energy is not enough to determine whether a coal plant will shut down. But the firms' report says that any coal plant failing that comparison should trigger ""a wake-up call for policymakers and local stakeholders that an opportunity for productive change exists in the immediate vicinity of that plant.""  Could batteries pick up the slack?  On Tuesday, Bloomberg New Energy Finance released a report saying that the LCOE of lithium-ion grid-scale batteries (that is, the cost of the batteries and installation divided by the amount of useable energy they'll provide over their lifetimes) has fallen 35 percent since the first half of 2018 to $187 per megawatt-hour.  Enlarge  For comparison, the VCE and Energy Innovation report that came out on Monday noted that most existing coal plants have an MCOE of $33 to $111 per megawatt-hour. If the price of batteries continues to fall as much as it did in 2018, banks of lithium-ion batteries could soon be competitive with a number of expensive but still-operational coal plants in the US. And unlike wind and solar, large banks of batteries offer dispatchable energy, which can be used regardless of whether the wind is blowing and the Sun is shining.  Still, waiting for economics to run its course and kill coal doesn't solve the problem of natural gas, which is extremely cheap and booming in the United States. Natural gas was partially responsible for the run-up in carbon emissions last year. To tackle that problem, it currently seems that policy or technology will have to intervene.                reader comments  46  with 31 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Megan Geuss Megan is a staff editor at Ars Technica.

It’s now just shy of four weeks later, and it appears the company may not have shipped a single one, while customers who placed orders are being told those cars have been delayed indefinitely, according to new reports in The Drive  and Tesla fan blog Electrek.  The Drive’s Ed Niedermeyer discovered multiple reports on Reddit and various Tesla forums — like the Tesla Motors Club , the Tesla Global Owners Club ,  even  the one on Tesla’s own website — where customers have received texts from the company telling them that their deliveries are being delayed. These customers have reportedly not been given a new delivery date in those texts, and while some have seen the estimate in their online accounts change to “six to eight” weeks, Tesla reps have reportedly told them not to trust those figures. (This “six to eight” week figure also shows up for new orders on Tesla’s website.)  Some customers claim Tesla is pushing them to buy a more expensive version of the car  In the meantime, some of these customers claim Tesla employees have contacted them after the delay to get them to buy more expensive Model 3s, like the “Standard Range Plus” version that starts at $37,500, which is a hair quicker, and offers slightly better range. Electrek reports seeing some of the same claims , though with far fewer receipts than The Drive .  Tesla declined to comment in response to a number of questions from The Verge .  In some ways, this fits with the approach Tesla has taken throughout its history. The company only recently started making cars on a massive scale, and has traditionally sold more expensive versions of its cars first to collect higher margins that it uses to buoy production of cheaper models. In fact, CEO Elon Musk said last year that the company had to sell more expensive versions of the car so the company wouldn’t die . But as both The Drive and Electrek point out, it’s odd to see one of Tesla’s cars delayed so close to the end of a financial quarter, when the company is once again increasing internal pressure to deliver as many cars as possible .  Waiting a few more weeks for a premium electric car might not seem like a big deal. But there is a ticking clock here, which is that Tesla’s cars are slowly losing eligibility for the federal electric vehicle tax credit. The company passed 200,000 electric vehicles sold in North America last summer, which is a milestone the government put in place so that the credit doesn’t last forever. Starting January 1st of this year, buyers were only eligible to get a credit of $3,750. That drops again on July 1st to $1,875, and fully expires at the end of the year.  More broadly, the apparent delay shows that Tesla wasn’t quite ready to deliver on the promise of a $35,000 version of the Model 3 when it made the late February announcement. Remember, this car debuted almost three years ago to the day, and the final version was shown off two years ago. Thousands of people on the preorder list have presumably been waiting ever since to order the most affordable version of Tesla’s “mass market” car. It took all those years, production hell , delivery logistics hell , and the decision to close a bunch of retail stores to get to the point where Tesla finally felt comfortable announcing the $35,000 Model 3 last month. But this week, it appears that there’s still a little more work to be done.

Sean Duffy,technology,"                        Demanding privacy, and establishing trust, in digital health     Sean Duffy  11 hours            Sean Duffy  Contributor    Sean Duffy is the co-founder and CEO of Omada Health , a digital behavioral medicine company focused on reducing costly chronic disease in employer and health plan populations.   February’s Wall Street Journal report pulled back the curtain on just how much is at stake when individuals share their personal health information with health and fitness applications. Several of these apps were (perhaps unwittingly) sharing users’ personal health information via a Facebook SDK that was automatically feeding that data to the platform. In one fell swoop, multiple companies damaged trust with their users — perhaps irrevocably.  But the dangers in digital health aren’t limited to rogue SDKs; three days after the Facebook news broke, yet another large health system announced the personal information of more than 325,00 patients had been exposed . All this comes as big tech companies like Apple, IBM and Amazon begin to enter the same space, with plans for huge impact. But even these well-established names enter healthcare with a trust deficit; Rock Health’s 2018 National Consumer Health Survey found that just 11 percent of respondents said they’d be willing to share health data with tech companies.  As we move toward an increasingly digitized world of healthcare — and as early-stage companies and tech behemoths operate alongside one another in the space — how can all involved uphold their responsibilities, follow relevant laws and regulations and maintain the trust of patients and users when it comes to privacy? Companies operating under the highest standards in healthcare are expressly prohibited from monetizing users’ data; how will large tech brand names adapt their business models to act properly?  In order for the promise of digital health to be realized, companies will need to ensure their patients’ data is safe, secure and error-free. Beyond security, healthcare companies operating as providers must also maintain the confidentiality and privacy of that data. Doing so isn’t simply good practice; it’s an existential requirement for companies operating in this space. There is a baseline expectation — from users, and from employers and health plans working with digital health companies — of privacy being maintained.  The success of digital health companies will hinge on whether patients feel comfortable sharing the most intimate data they possess — their personal health information (PHI) — especially when they worry that data could impact their employment . Below are three things digital health companies would do well to keep in mind as they operate in the space.  Comply with — and inform — regulations  In 2018 alone, more than 6.1 million individuals were impacted by healthcare data breaches. Many have started to warn of the “data breach tsunami.” Complacency is no longer viable. The increasing frequency of data breaches should become a rallying cry. When it comes to PHI, protecting the privacy and security of patients and users must be a business imperative.    Patients want to focus on getting better, not having to constantly check their privacy settings.    Complying with regulations and requirements for protecting PHI requires a combination of robust privacy and security strategies. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the baseline for patient data protection. For companies operating under HIPAA, responsibilities, obligations and opportunities become crystal clear. Federal laws and regulations prescribe privacy and security minimums, as well as the exact rules governing collection, storage and transfer of participant data. For health innovators, strong privacy practices and security controls are key to customer trust and to growth.  This also means that digital health companies must be active participants in shaping the regulations that govern their operations. This isn’t a call to hire as many lobbyists as possible to water down your responsibilities; it’s a demand to educate the state and federal policymakers who will be writing the rules of the road that govern your work for the next phase of healthcare. Informed policy that enables creative iteration while putting the needs of the patient at its center is imperative for the continued success of the entire industry. This is a space where regulations can be helpful in clearly identifying what not to do to be taken seriously — and operate properly — as a digital health company.  HIPAA or not: know your role  HIPAA applies to digital health companies — whether they contract as a vendor (a “business associate”) or a healthcare provider (a “covered entity”). Third-parties, especially those that handle PHI, have the potential of exposing health companies to data breaches and non-compliance. Any data breach suffered by a healthcare company will have serious consequences, including reputational damage, government investigations and monetary damages.  Once credibility has been tarnished, it takes significant time to rebuild trust among consumers. Fundamental to this is understanding the difference between operating in technology broadly versus in digital health, and ensuring that your organization is equipped with a deep understanding of all the ins-and-outs of HIPAA and health care data; patients want to focus on getting better, not having to constantly check their privacy settings.  Keep compliance at your core  The healthcare industry is already fraught with risk. New laws and market forces only add to the complexities. In order to reach full maturity, digital health companies need to invest, early, in information security experts who understand the intersection of medical devices, software and regulations. Senior leadership teams must empower these experts while staying engaged on best practices and the latest threats. This goes against the rapid growth mindset of venture-backed companies in other industries, but is critical when it comes to healthcare.  If you are handling patient data, hiring a legal and compliance team is a top priority. By implementing a privacy and compliance program, you’ll be better equipped to find and correct potential vulnerabilities, while reducing the chance of fraud, and promoting safe and quality care.  The responsibility to establish trust in digital health is on the most prominent actors in a rapidly growing space. Data and its proper application hold the keys to the evolution of healthcare. But we must never forget that patients and users are opting to share the most intimate data they have. We must meet that responsibility with the systems, personnel and maturity it deserves.

The product is, on the surface, a way for Apple to sell its brand on another everyday object you likely already own. But beneath the veneer of a titanium credit card with the Apple logo on it, the company is clearly charting out its post-iPhone future, one in which services reign supreme , by following a formula we’ve never quite seen it attempt before.  In this case, Apple has decided that it needs a traditional product, even one with the dubious moral baggage of a credit card, to promote Apple Pay. While the digital wallet and payment platform is growing fast, it’s still used by less than half of all global iPhone owners (and even less in the US). So just as Apple sees competing with Netflix and large cable companies as part of its future by creating its own TV shows and paying top dollar for Hollywood talent, the company no longer sees upending the status quo in payments as a viable path forward for Apple Pay.  “I think the strange optic here is that credit cards are not necessarily innovation in payments, even with better rates and loyalty,” says Rivka Gewirtz Little, a global research director at analyst firm IDC who specializes in payments. “So, to see a big tech firm, which hangs its hat on innovation, go such a traditional route – that’s what I think is a bit odd here. I’d like to see Apple get more innovative in transforming the way we pay.”  “The strange optic here is that credit cards are not necessarily innovation in payments.”  For years, as the iPhone has become ubiquitous and sales have started to slow, Apple has tried to emulate the paradigm-shifting success of the App Store and iTunes before it by barreling its way into TV and film, mobile payments, and news. But time and again over the last half-decade or so, Apple has run into the hard economic and logistic reality of trying to change industries that are far less malleable than mobile software and music.  And while Apple Pay may be a bold vision of the future, it’ll likely be years before contactless digital payments become truly mainstream in the US. In the meantime, Apple wants to sell you the benign and the boring — a credit card, a cable package, a magazine subscription — in hopes it can make its software and services as intrinsic a part of everyday life as its smartphone. Changing industries from the ground up is no longer Apple’s playbook, especially as it plays catch-up to companies like Netflix and Spotify.  Apple’s strategy mirrors that of Amazon. The e-commerce giant started out selling genuinely new and best-in-class products like the Kindle and then the AI-powered Echo speaker. But Amazon has since used the consumer goodwill it garnered and the power it wields over its digital storefront  to sell you everything from microwaves and wall clocks to white label clothing brands, home supplies, and AmazonBasics-branded AA batteries.            Image: Apple    Apple is doing the same, using the iPhone as the ultimate gateway to transform every iOS and Mac user into a series of multiple recurring revenue streams from products made first and in some cases made better by other companies, be it Apple Music, Apple News, iCloud, or the new TV app. Apple is stopping short of making its own version of Prime, in which all of these services could be bundled together, but the company appears to be taking its cues from Amazon’s subscription approach to further lock iPhone owners into a broader ecosystem.  With the Apple Card, the company is going one step further and trying to capture not just what you consume, but also the financial means you use to do so. Apple isn’t reinventing the wheel — the card, as reported by CNET , doesn’t have contactless capabilities like newer cards from competing banks, so you’ll need to slide it or input the chip into a reader to use it every time. Instead, Apple is giving users a no-frills credit card that’s a cleverly disguised way to juice Apple Pay adoption and usage.  The Apple Card is a way for Apple to become the way you pay for everything  Unlike the subscription services it plans to sell, the Apple Card comes with no annual fee, no late lees, and an interest rate supposedly lower than the industry average. On top of that, it has a pretty straightforward rewards program that incentivizes consumers to use Apple Pay to buy Apple products, for the most cash back at 3 percent thanks likely to the fact that Apple no longer has to hand over as high a processing fee as it does with a third-party card. If you have to use the physical Mastercard-branded card, you’ll get 1 percent back. (Granted, when it launches, the Apple Card will be one of the only cards on the market without a sign-up bonus, the primary incentivizing mechanism banks use to get people to open new lines of credit.)  To get customers to actually sign up, Apple is leaning heavily on its privacy-first approach. Effectively, Apple wants to be the only tech company you actually trust . Onstage yesterday, CEO Tim Cook said the card will not collect data on your transactions, and Apple will not let its partner bank, Goldman Sachs, sell any data to third parties. But of course that begs the question: how does it make money, and without those usual stipulations, is Apple not simply banking on users falling into debt and pocketing the insurance money they’re forced to pay for years to come?  The goal may not be to turn a profit, at least not on the service itself. It all comes back to Apple Pay. The reason Apple made a credit card in the first place is to spur adoption of Apple Pay, and to create a digital wallet that can be used not just in the real world, but also inside an iOS ecosystem that is increasingly being peppered with new, for-pay services.            Image: Apple    “Mobile wallets are still a small section of the market, so it’s understandable there needs to be a big push if your aim is more adoption,” says Rasha Katabi, CEO and co-founder of credit card and digital payments startup Brim Financial. “As the adoption of e-commerce increases, and we’ve seen that at an exponential rate over the past few years, the relevance of having a physical card or lack thereof will track really closely to the adoption and migration from physical shopping to fully online shopping.”  The only online shopping Apple truly cares about happens within its ecosystem: in-app subscriptions for its new services, microtransactions in mobile games like Fortnite , Venmo-style peer-to-peer payments with Apple Cash, and purchasing of Apple hardware from within the Apple Store mobile app. All of this qualifies for the 3 percent cash back bonus, Apple confirmed to The Verge . And that arrangement sheds an interesting light on the entire Apple Card approach.  The success of the Apple Card may hinge on whether it gets used for all in-app purchases  Through its incentives, Apple is creating a system where you’ll shop in the real world at Apple Pay partners for an extra cash back bonus, switch your App Store credit card to an Apple one with an even better bonus, and rely only on the physical card for when you absolutely have to. And all of it is underpinned by Apple’s privacy pledge and relatively solid security track record, as well as the luxury status symbol provided by an Apple-branded piece of titanium , with its number-less design that non-coincidentally makes it easy to gloat about on social media.    Apple pushing people to keep cash inside the Apple ecosystem is not to be underestimated! They are playing a long game here. If successful, this is very bad for the card networks. — Peter Berg (@peter) March 26, 2019     That may be enticing enough to get younger users, especially those without large stockpiles of reward points and years of credit built with existing banks and cards, to turn to Apple as their primary credit provider. Credit cards, especially those underwritten by Goldman Sachs and backed by dinosaurs like Mastercard, are not the most innovative products. Neither are TV bundles or magazine subscriptions.  But Apple’s services strategy, similar to its hardware strategy in the Tim Cook era, is not about being first, but about providing an Apple-centric option that’s good enough to keep you hooked in and uninterested in ever leaving.

Sean Gallagher - Mar 26, 2019 11:06 pm UTC         Enlarge  / A Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed in October 2018 because of problems with a sensor and a failure of flight control software. The crew had little time to react, data shows. PK-REN, Jakarta, Indonesia     reader comments  131  with 58 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      In testing performed in a simulator, Boeing test pilots recreated the conditions aboard Lion Air Flight 610 when it went down in the Java Sea in October, killing 189 people. The tests showed that the crew of the 737 MAX 8 would have only had 40 seconds to respond to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System’s (MCAS’s) attempts to correct a stall that wasn’t happening before the aircraft went into an unrecoverable dive, according to a report by The New York Times . by  While the test pilots were able to correct the issue with the flip of three switches, their training on the systems far exceeded that of the Lion Air crew—and that of the similarly doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed earlier this month. The Lion Air crew was heard on cockpit voice recorders checking flight manuals in an attempt to diagnose what was going on moments before they died.  One of the controls—the electric stabilizer trim thumbswitch on the pilot’s control yoke—could temporarily reset MCAS’s control over stabilizers. The Lion Air pilots hit this switch over 24 times, buying them some time—but MCAS’ stall prevention software kicked in afterwards each time because of faulty data coming from the aircraft’s primary angle of attack sensor.  Completely disabling MCAS’ control over the aircraft’s stabilizers would be the only way to overcome that sensor failure in the current software version. That requires throwing two additional switches on the console and turning a trim wheel on the console manually to re-establish manual control.  The Lion Air crew would have had to accomplish this while dealing with a host of alerts, including differences in other sensor data between the pilot and co-pilot positions that made it unclear what the aircraft’s altitude was. As a result, the crew continued to fight MCAS’ attempts to push the nose down until the end.  Boeing is in the process of getting a software patch for MCAS ready for approval by the Federal Aviation Administration that corrects many of the problems that led to the Lion Air crash and may have contributed to the Ethiopia Airlines crash. That update is expected to be issued by the end of April, and it includes a previously optional feature that alerts air crews when the aircraft’s two angle of attack sensors are giving different information (a “disagree light”).  Piling it on  While the 737 MAX is currently prohibited from carrying commercial passengers, airlines can still fly the aircraft to ferry them to other locations. Southwest Airlines has been moving its 737 MAX aircraft to an aircraft parking facility in California.  But today, one of those aircraft had to make an emergency landing in Orlando shortly after it took off. The emergency this time wasn’t related to flight software—instead, it was because of an engine problem , according to a Southwest spokesperson.                reader comments  131  with 58 posters participating, including story author    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Sean Gallagher Sean is Ars Technica's IT and National Security Editor.

Email     Twitter     Facebook     LinkedIn     WhatsApp     Messenger       Ask a teen today how she communicates with her friends, and she’ll probably hold up her smartphone. Not that she actually calls her friends; it’s more likely that she texts them or messages them on social media.  Today’s teens – the generation I call “ iGen ” that’s also called Gen Z – are constantly connected with their friends via digital media, spending as much as nine hours a day on average with screens.  How might this influence the time they spend with their friends in person?  Some studies have found that people who spend more time on social media actually have more face time with friends .  But studies like this are only looking at people already operating in a world suffused with smartphones. They can’t tell us how teens spent their time before and after digital media use surged .  What if we zoomed out and compared how often previous generations of teens spent time with their friends to how often today’s teens are doing so? And what if we also saw how feelings of loneliness differed across the generations?  To do this, my co-authors and I examined trends in how 8.2 million U.S. teens spent time with their friends since the 1970s. It turns out that today’s teens are socializing with friends in fundamentally different ways – and also happen to be the loneliest generation on record.  Less work, but fewer hangs?  After studying two large, nationally representative surveys, we found that although the amount of time teens spent with their friends face to face has declined since the 1970s, the drop accelerated after 2010 – just as smartphones use started to grow.  Compared with teenagers in previous decades, iGen teens are less likely to get together with their friends. They’re also less likely to go to parties, go out with friends, date, ride in cars for fun, go to shopping malls or go to the movies.  It’s not because they are spending more time on work, homework or extracurricular activities. Today’s teens hold fewer paid jobs, homework time is either unchanged or down since the 1990s, and time spent on extracurricular activities is about the same.  Yet they’re spending less time with their friends in person – and by large margins. In the late 1970s, 52 percent of 12th-graders got together with their friends almost every day. By 2017, only 28 percent did. The drop was especially pronounced after 2010.   Today’s 10th-graders go to about 17 fewer parties a year than 10th-graders in the 1980s did. Overall, 12th-graders now spend an hour less on in-person social interaction on an average day than their Gen X predecessors did.  We wondered if these trends would have implications for feelings of loneliness, which are also measured in one of the surveys. Sure enough, just as the drop in face-to-face time accelerated after 2010, teens’ feelings of loneliness shot upward.  Among 12th graders, 39 percent said they often felt lonely in 2017, up from 26 percent in 2012. Thirty-eight percent said they often felt left out in 2017, up from 30 percent in 2012. In both cases, the 2017 numbers were all-time highs since the questions were first asked in 1977, with loneliness declining among teens before suddenly increasing.   A new cultural norm  As previous studies have shown, we did find that those teens who spent more time on social media also spent more time with their friends in person.  So why have in-person social interactions been going down, overall, as digital media use has increased?  It has to do with the group versus the individual.  Imagine a group of friends that doesn’t use social media. This group regularly gets together, but the more outgoing members are willing to hang out more than others, who might stay home once in a while. Then they all sign up for Instagram. The social teens are still more likely to meet up in person, and they’re also more active on their accounts.  However, the total number of in-person hangs for everyone in the group drops as social media replaces some face-to-face time.  So the decline in face-to-face interaction among teens isn’t just an individual issue; it’s a generational one. Even teens who eschew social media are affected: Who will hang out with them when most of their peers are alone in their bedrooms scrolling through Instagram?  Higher levels of loneliness are just the tip of the iceberg. Rates of depression and unhappiness also skyrocketed among teens after 2012, perhaps because spending more time with screens and less time with friends isn’t the best formula for mental health.  Some have argued that teens are simply choosing to communicate with their friends in a different way , so the shift toward electronic communication isn’t concerning.  That argument assumes that electronic communication is just as good for assuaging loneliness and depression as face-to-face interaction. It seems clear that this isn’t the case. There’s something about being around another person – about touch, about eye contact, about laughter – that can’t be replaced by digital communication.  The result is a generation of teens who are lonelier than ever before.

Peter Bright - Mar 26, 2019 8:42 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Lightning bolts have currents from 5,000 up to perhaps as many as 200,000 amps. John Fowler / Flickr     reader comments  111  with 85 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Google is bringing AMP, its cut-down version of HTML, to email. Starting today, Gmail on the Web will be able to support embedded AMP content, with support rolling out to mobile clients later. Gmail will also be joined by Outlook.com, Yahoo Mail, and Mail.Ru, with their respective developers promising to add support soon.  AMP for email isn't just a warmed-over version of email with HTML formatting. The embedded AMP content will be able to offer features such as interactivity without having to click away from your inbox. For example, an online store could send you an email about a product or promotion you're likely to be interested in, and the AMP embed could allow scrolling through pictures of the products and even initiate the purchasing process. Or Pinterest could email you a selection of the day's popular items and you could pin them directly from your inbox.  Accelerated Mobile Pages were introduced by Google in 2015 as a narrow set of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS capabilities that produced pages that are fast to download and render, could easily be packaged together, and were amenable to being embedded in, for example, Google search results pages. JavaScript features were limited to those offered by a Google-supplied library. This greatly curtails the range of things that pages can do in favor of being extremely cache-friendly and having consistently good performance.   /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ezgif-2-7ed55c47bf0d.mp4  AMP was met with some resistance at its introduction. Web developers questioned Google's approach—its JavaScript library is used to define special tags rather than using conventional HTML—as well as the need for a specific, narrowly defined format to achieve good performance. Some of these concerns have been mediated by Google's plan to build AMP on Web standards and introduce a new governance model that ceded control to a pair of committees. Sitting on those committees would be representatives from across both the technology and the content publishing industries.  Those limitations are arguably what enable AMP's interactivity in email. It would be dangerous to support the browser's full, unrestricted range of JavaScript capabilities in an HTML email, but that same danger doesn't exist for an AMP email, because the JavaScript library is carefully controlled and limited. AMP emails can't perform arbitrary scripting; instead, they opt into certain prepackaged pieces of behavior that they want to use.                reader comments  111  with 85 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

"Anthony Ha, Jordan Crook",technology,"                        Original Content podcast: ‘Triple Frontier’ sends famous faces on a grim hike over the Andes     Anthony Ha  Jordan Crook  11 hours         Even by the standards of the often, ah, “wide-ranging” conversations on the Original Content podcast , this latest episode covers a lot of ground.  The initial focus is “Triple Frontier,” a film directed by J.C. Chandor and starring Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Pedro Pascal, Charlie Hunnam and Garrett Hedlund as friends who served in the special forces together, and who reunite to rob an infamous drug lord.  The film starts off as a relatively straightforward thriller, but in its second half, it becomes increasingly focused on the morality of these former soldiers, and even more on the mechanics of the robbery — not how you’d steal $250 million in cash, but how you’d actually get that money home.  As you probably guessed, things do not go according to plan, and we’re soon treated to multiple shots of handsome men grimly dragging duffel bags of money over the mountains. It’s an intriguing idea, even if it doesn’t quite deliver the emotional payoff that we’d hoped for.  Because we’re joined by the podcast’s original co-host Darrell Etherington, we also take some time to recap the latest season of “The Bachelor,” and to debate Netflix’s decision to test out different episode orders for the anthologies series “Love, Death & Robots,” which then leads to a discussion of a recent piece by the critic Sean T. Collins arguing that Netflix is taking a depressingly derivative and uninspired approach to TV.  We close the episode with a spoiler-filled discussion of “The Umbrella Academy” — which we reviewed a few weeks ago , but seemed worth revisiting, now that we’ve all finished the first season.

Eric Berger - Mar 26, 2019 8:21 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. NASA     reader comments  167  with 101 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      On Tuesday, at a museum within a stone's throw of Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, Vice President Mike Pence delivered a significant space policy speech that called for American men and women to return to the Moon by 2024. If the Trump administration follows through on the policies Pence outlined—admittedly a huge if —this was arguably the most consequential space speech since President Kennedy's Moon speech in 1962.  However, Pence's comments, and some of the plan later outlined by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, raised significant questions about the viability of these ideas.  Further Reading Vice President may tell NASA to accelerate lunar landings  During a 30-minute speech that Ars previewed last week, Pence said NASA has moved too slow for too long. Half a century ago, the agency only took eight years to go to the Moon, Pence said, when NASA didn't know how to do the job. Therefore, he was not satisfied with NASA's stated aim of landing humans on the Moon by 2028, which would come 11 years after President Trump first established the goal of returning humans to the lunar surface.  ""Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not good enough,"" Pence told the National Space Council during its meeting at the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ""We're better than that.""  A bold speech  In setting a goal of 2024 for landing humans on the Moon—at the lunar South Pole, no less—Pence said NASA must proceed with ""urgency"" if it is to achieve these aims. ""It's up to this generation to meet the challenge of our time,"" he said.  Critically, Pence also noted that NASA's oft-delayed Space Launch System rocket has been problematic from a budget and schedule standpoint. In calling for a ""major course correction"" at NASA, Pence said the agency must be willing to consider commercial alternatives for rockets and lunar landers if they can do the job and save the government money.  ""I call on NASA to adopt new policies and embrace a new mindset,"" Pence said. ""If our current contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones that will."" This was likely a reference, at least in part, to lower-cost rockets built by SpaceX and Blue Origin.  Further Reading How I learned to stop worrying and love the big $60B NASA rocket  This was a bold speech ( see full text ). In his remarks, the vice president plainly stated what has been an open—but rarely talked about—secret in space policy circles. Large contractors on the Space Launch System, Orion, and other programs have under-delivered for the billions of dollars they have received. The agency has basically been in ""development mode"" for deep-space exploration for 15 years with no actual exploration to show for it, and it's on course to remain so for a while.  After Pence's speech, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine was invited to speak for a few minutes about how NASA might achieve this goal. ""You have given us a charge today, and it is right on time,"" Bridenstine said. ""Thank you for that vision and that leadership. Our agency, NASA, is going to do everything in its power to meet that deadline.""  To accomplish this, however, Bridenstine doubled down on the Space Launch System rocket. ""If we want to achieve 2024, we have to have SLS,"" Bridenstine said. The rocket will be delayed no more, he said. In fact, although internally NASA engineers say the booster cannot be ready before 2021, its launch date will be brought forward.  Further Reading Here’s why NASA’s administrator made such a bold move Wednesday  On Tuesday, Bridenstine said Exploration Mission-1, which involves flying an uncrewed version of Orion around the Moon, will proceed on the SLS booster in 2020. This announcement came less than two weeks after his suggestion that maybe NASA should launch the first lunar flight of Orion on commercial rockets due to ongoing SLS delays.  In another surprising turnaround, Bridenstine also said the agency must now accelerate work on an advanced upper stage for the SLS rocket, known as the Exploration Upper Stage. This will be needed for the third or fourth flight of the SLS rocket (presumably part of the build-up for lunar missions). But Bridenstine did not say why. By contrast, the president's budget request released earlier this month called for deferring funding on this upper stage until such time as it was needed. Regardless, it is difficult seeing this upper stage, essentially a new rocket, being ready by 2024.  NASA will also simultaneously pursue the development of a Lunar Gateway (a small outpost near the Moon) to serve as a staging point in orbit for missions to the surface. And NASA will start (and complete) development of lunar landers, likely through commercial providers. That is a lot to put on NASA's plate, certainly too much if we go by past performance at the agency.  In summary  All of this is therefore ambitious, because Pence's vision seeks to shock NASA and its legacy contractors out of their business-as-usual posture.  What happens next is not entirely clear. Little was mentioned of budget. Unless NASA entirely scraps the SLS program and its $3 billion annual budget, the agency will have no funds for instituting a lunar landing program. But as an SLS demise seems unlikely to happen (at least for now), NASA's exploration program will require a multibillion-dollar infusion in order to be viable. Later at the meeting, Pence gestured toward James Herz, an associate director at the White House Office of Management and Budget. ""Well, we'll be coming to OMB,"" Pence said.  Further Reading New White House budget spells trouble for NASA’s SLS rocket  It is also not clear how moved Congress will be by this initiative. Clearly, Bridenstine's remarks Tuesday about launching Orion on SLS reflect pushback from Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who supports the development of the big rocket in his state at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The senator with power over NASA's budget has evidently said no to a commercially launched Orion and yes to funding for the Exploration Upper Stage.  In short, while Pence promised a revolutionary approach to spaceflight during his speech Tuesday, Bridenstine's proposed architecture—which includes the SLS rocket, Gateway, and Exploration Upper Stage—feels very much like business as usual.                reader comments  167  with 101 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Eric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA.

Now, Asus says it has a fix in the form of an actual security update — one that you can download using its Live Update software tool.  In addition, the company says it has a second “security diagnostic” tool you can use to scan to see if your computer has been affected. “[W]e encourage users who are still concerned to run it as a precaution,” reads part of the company’s press release , which includes a link to the software.  The company’s press release notably does not include an apology, and it downplays the hack, stating that “Only a very small number of specific user group were found to have been targeted.” Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab had previously estimated that the malware could have been distributed to as many as 1 million computers, and installed on hundreds of thousands of those machines, which doesn’t sound like a small number to me. Both Kaspersky and Symantec say they’d identified the malware in at least tens of thousands of cases.  However, Asus does say it’s taken steps to ensure such a trojan horse won’t make it through again, including “multiple security verification mechanisms to prevent any malicious manipulation” and “an enhanced end-to-end encryption mechanism.”  “At the same time, we have also updated and strengthened our server-to-end-user software architecture to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future,” Asus says.

Beth Mole - Mar 26, 2019 10:53 pm UTC         Enlarge  / HOPKINS, Minn. - APRIL, 27: Abdullahi Mohamud, 5, awaits returning to school after two of his siblings contracted the measles during an current outbreak. Getty | Courtney Perry     reader comments  66  with 50 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit      Plagued by a tenacious outbreak of measles that began last October, New York's Rockland County declared a state of emergency Tuesday and issued a directive barring unvaccinated children from all public spaces.  Further Reading Anti-vax parents sue to keep unvaccinated kids in school during outbreak Effective at midnight Wednesday, March 27, anyone aged 18 or younger who has not been vaccinated against the measles is prohibited from public spaces in Rockland for 30 days or until they get vaccinated. Public spaces are defined broadly in the directive as any places:  [W]here more than 10 persons are intended to congregate for purposes such as civic, governmental, social, or religious functions, or for recreation or shopping, or for food or drink consumption, or awaiting transportation, or for daycare or educational purposes, or for medical treatment. A place of public assembly shall also include public transportation vehicles, including but not limited to, publicly or privately owned buses or trains...  The directive follows an order from the county last December that barred unvaccinated children from schools that did not reach a minimum of 95 percent vaccination rate. That order—and the directive issued today—are intended to thwart the long-standing outbreak, which has sickened 153 people, mostly children .  ""We must not allow this outbreak to continue indefinitely,"" County Executive Ed Day said in a statement announcing the emergency declaration.  ""Every action we have taken since the beginning of this outbreak has been designed to maximize vaccinations and minimize exposures. We are taking the next step in that endeavor today,"" he explained. ""We must do everything in our power to end this outbreak and protect the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and that of children too young to be vaccinated.""  The outbreak kicked off when an international traveler sick with the highly-contagious viral illness arrived in the county late last September. It has largely spread among the county's insular Orthodox Jewish community. However, other pockets of the county also have low vaccination rates, making them vulnerable.  Earlier this month, anti-vaccine parents appeared in federal court, bringing a lawsuit against the county alleging that banning their unvaccinated children from schools violated their religious freedom. The parents had used religious exemptions to opt their children out of standard vaccinations. The judge in the case denied their request to issue a temporary injunction that would let the children return to school.  But the lawsuit isn't the only opposition the county has faced as it tries to stamp out the infections.  Further Reading Emergency declared near Portland for measles outbreak in anti-vaccine hotspot ""As this outbreak has continued, our inspectors have begun to meet resistance from those they are trying to protect. They have been hung up on or told not to call again. They've been told 'we're not discussing this, do not come back,' when visiting the homes of infected individuals as part of their investigations,"" Day noted in today's announcement. ""This type of response is unacceptable and irresponsible. It endangers the health and wellbeing of others and displays a shocking lack of responsibility and concern for others in our community.""  Rockland county is one of six locations nationwide currently experiencing an outbreak of measles . So far this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied 314 confirmed cases of the disease from 15 states. The agency recorded 372 cases total for 2018 and just 120 in 2017.                reader comments  66  with 50 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Beth Mole Beth is Ars Technica’s health reporter.

          in Mobile          Comments      111  Shares             Share              Tweet              Share              Save                                            Since it first partnered with Leica on the P9 , Huawei has focused on delivering unique cameras on its flagships. With the P30 and P30 Pro, the company continues that tradition by serving up a four-camera setup with an intriguing new sensor that promises vastly improved performance in low light.            The four cameras on the P30 Pro are a 40-megapixel Super Spectrum sensor, an ultra-wide 20-megapixel one, a so-called ""Periscope zoom"" setup that offers 5x optical zoom, as well as a time of flight depth-sensing camera.            Gallery: Huawei P30 and P30 Pro hands on | 34 Photos         34                       +30              You'll mainly be using the Super Spectrum camera, which to me is the most intriguing feature. Instead of using an RGB color filter on top of the monochrome layer of the sensor, Huawei swapped out the greens for yellow, which it says lets in more light (since yellow light has longer wavelengths than green).The company then recalibrated its processing algorithms to calculate the right color values from yellow. The benefit of this is much better light sensitivity. In fact, Huawei said the P30 Pro can actually go up to ISO 409,600. And while the regular P30 can only hit ISO 204,800, that's still twice what the P20 Pro is capable of (ISO 102,400). I took the P30 Pro into a dark hallway to shoot some plates of yummy snacks and was surprised at how bright the image looked. It was impressively sharp with rich colors, and looked almost as if I'd taken it in a regularly lit office. This improved light sensitivity can also be used in videos or under regular daylight to get higher shutter speeds. When you need to squeeze more of the scene into your shot, the 20-MP ultra wide angle camera comes in handy. Huawei says it has a field of view larger than 120 degrees, though it declined to share exact numbers. I switched lenses while pointing the P30 Pro at a nearby building. Initially, I was only able to frame one tower and half of another from a rooftop patio across the street. Switching over to the ultra-wide lens let me squeeze in other adjacent skyscrapers from about a block away on either side. I used the zoom camera to get up close to some windows and details on the edge of the building, as well as some spines of books on a shelf. I was surprised at the clarity I got even at 10x zoom, and could clearly see the stamped leather texture of book covers. This combination of super wide and close-up cameras will very likely make the P30 Pro incredibly useful at concerts, vast fields or almost any potentially challenging shooting situation. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try out the time of flight sensor specifically, since Huawei said it doesn't do anything yet. It's supposed to help with some AR tools like measuring the length, width and height of objects around you. This function could be very helpful, but I'll have to wait till I get to test it out to judge. Still photography has long been a focus for Huawei, but with the P30 and P30 Pro, it's turning its attention to videography. On the latest flagships, the company uses a combination of optical and AI stabilization to reduce shaky cam effects. You can make use of the 10x hybrid zoom when filming, too. When I tried getting up close with a distant window while recording a clip though, the footage had a weird jitter. I didn't see this distortion when filming at less than 3x zoom, though. There's a fifth camera on the P30s, and that's the 32MP selfie shooter. That seems a tad excessive for selfies, but the pictures I snapped with the P30 Pro looked pleasant anyway. Huawei tweaked its HDR algorithms with AI to better capture the detail in your face even if there's a very bright light source behind you, though it did tend to wash out the background a bit. The camera is housed in a tiny notch at the top of the edge-to-edge display, and this cutout is smaller than those you'll find on the P20 Pro , the Galaxy S10+ , the iPhone XS Max and the Pixel 3 XL . To be fair, Samsung's flagship keeps its notch tucked away in the top right corner so it feels less obtrusive, but I found the P30 Pro's cutout easy to ignore.         Cherlynn Low / Engadget          The rest of the P30 Pro's 6.47-inch curved OLED panel is bright and vibrant, and the rounded sides make the phone feel classier than its predecessor. The regular P30 has a flat 6.1-inch screen, so it feels a little less elegant than its larger brother. Both the P30 and P30 Pro have a 2,340 x 1,080 resolution, making the bigger handset slightly less pixel dense. I didn't notice a significant difference in image quality, but I do wish they were both a bit brighter -- they were a little tough to see outside, even on a cloudy day. Under the screen lies another intriguing piece of technology, though I didn't get to test it out as the company only mentioned it briefly. The P30 Pro will also pack a new speaker feature that will deliver audio through the screen, vibrating the sound to the user. But why? Well it should mean no one else can hear your calls, to start with. Plus, it leaves one less thing to clutter up the front of the phone. Huawei also uses an in-display fingerprint sensor on the P30s, just like it did with the Mate 20 . Instead of opting for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor like Samsung did on the Galaxy S10s, Huawei is continuing to use an optical scanner, which could be less secure since it only scans an image of your fingerprint instead of actually reading the ridges on your skin. I did appreciate Huawei's helpful onscreen indicators though, and the P30 Pro logged me in pretty quickly -- within a second of my touching the screen. In fact, the new flagships felt remarkably swift during my hands-on. The Kirin 980 chipset with 6GB of RAM is a beefy combination, but Huawei also worked to improve its EMUI 9.1 software overlay on top of Android 9 Pie . The company said it tweaked its software so that launching an app is now 52 percent faster than before, while the response time of a tap is now 69 percent faster. These upgrades showed when I launched app after app, and jumped from settings to Google Maps to Chrome. The phone didn't feel like it was simply keeping up, it felt like the P30 Pro was almost pre-empting my moves. Buildings even popped up instantly when I zoomed in on cities in Google Maps. Still, the P30 Pro I was using was brand new, and I expect that over time and with other processes and apps running, the performance will be different. Huawei also offers a couple of rather specific special software features on the P30s. If you own an Audi car, you can use your P30 as a key via the new Audi Connect digital key. For gym rats, you can pull your information directly from a compatible treadmill into the Huawei Health app, and those who own Huawei laptops can seamlessly send files and record their notebook screens with the OneHop service. These all sound somewhat useful, though their appeal is clearly limited. Powering the P30 Pro is 4,200mAh battery (3,650mAh on the P30), which Huawei says will last over 24 hours even with heavy use. Plus, with the company's new 40W Super Charge technology, you can get the P30 Pro up to 70 percent in just 30 minutes. The regular P30 doesn't offer the new fast charging standard, though both phones do offer reverse wireless charging like the Galaxy S10 (and the Mate 20 Pro). With this, you can juice up compatible accessories by placing the device on your phone. I didn't get to test this out so I'm not exactly sure how it works yet, and Huawei hasn't shared what wireless charging standard this is compatible with. Finally, all this is wrapped up in a gorgeous frame. Huawei's P series is known for its unique and attractive finishes, and the P30s come in an array of gradients that I couldn't help but gawk at. There's the signature Aurora finish that's a white-purple gradient, a green-purple option called ""Breathing crystal,"" a white-pink-yellow flavor called ""Pearl white,"" an orange-red version called ""Amber sunrise,"" and a basic black for the less adventurous. The P30 and P30 Pro seem like they have a lot to offer. They're powerful, attractive flagships with versatile cameras and some unique features. In the UK, at least, the P30 Pro is priced at £899 for 128GB model, or £1099 for the 512GB model, while the P30 will cost £699 at launch. But chances are, they'll never make their way to the US. So, best to keep your excitement in check. Mat Smith contributed reporting.

Connie Loizos,technology,"                        A new lawsuit involving Stanford and Sequoia Capital highlights fights to come over cell-free DNA testing     Connie Loizos   @Cookie  / 11 hours         This morning, a publicly traded transplant diagnostics company called CareDx , along with Stanford University, sued another publicly traded genetic testing company, Natera , for patent infringement.  Much appears to be at stake, and it all centers on cell-free DNA testing, a type of technology that has already been at the crux of numerous lawsuits and looks poised to play center stage again in future corporate battles.  Loosely defined, cell-free DNA (or cfDNA) technology involves blood tests that enable physicians to understand what’s happening in someone’s body. They’re not looking at red or white blood cells (thus the “cell free” part) but at plasma, which carries pieces of broken-up DNA, among other things.  Companies like newly public Guardant Health are using it to try to ensure that cancer patients receive the right drugs. Prenatal cfDNA screening has meanwhile become a common way to screen for specific chromosomal problems in a developing baby — including Down syndrome, trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. The latter has become particularly popular as an alternative to amniocentesis, a more intrusive, and sometimes high-risk, procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus.  Yet another way that cfDNA testing can monitor clinical conditions and make a major impact on healthcare is by distinguishing the relative proportion of DNA molecules in a patient’s blood after that person has had an organ transplant. Though traditionally, recipients have had to undergo biopsies to gauge whether or not their new organ was being accepted or rejected, it’s now possible to measure through the far-less traumatic process of providing blood samples. (Broadly speaking, if, over time, the amount of donor DNA increases in the patient’s blood, things aren’t going well.)  It’s an important, if relatively new, development, and CareDx, a 19-year-old, Brisbane, Calif.-based company that went public in 2014, claims in its newly filed lawsuit that two patents it controls give it the exclusive right to non-invasively diagnose graft rejection in a great many organ transplant patients via cfDNA testing. What we mean: one of the patents covers “kidney transplant, a heart transplant, a liver transplant, a pancreas transplant, a lung transplant, a skin transplant, and any combination thereof.” The second patent covers 16 different methods, devices, compositions and kits for diagnosing or predicting transplant status or patient outcome.  The patents were awarded in recent years to Stanford academics, including Stephen Quake, a renowned professor of bioengineering and applied physics. Though Stanford owns the patents, however, it licenses them to CareDx, and they’ve dramatically enhanced the company’s prospects. Indeed, while its shares were priced at $10 apiece at the time of its IPO, they’ve been trading at $40 each more recently, thanks largely to its AlloSure test, which is designed specifically for kidney transplant patients and, critically, is now covered by Medicare.  Indeed, CareDx’s lawsuit against 15-year-old Natera, which went public in 2015, accuses it of “preparing to develop and commercialize” a too-similar kidney transplant rejection test beginning in the middle of last year. It’s seeking cash compensation and a court order that blocks the sale of Natera’s offering. It’s an offensive move, too, seemingly, given all those other organs at stake and the markets they could unlock.  Natera, which counts Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha as a board member, did not provide an executive to comment on the suit. Botha also declined through a Sequoia spokesperson to comment. But Natera sent us the following statement about it: “We are confident that we will prevail in this suit should it proceed and do not expect this suit to impact our commercialization plans or disrupt our operations in any way. We are not surprised that CareDx would attempt to disrupt the imminent commercialization of Natera’s innovative organ transplant rejection test, which does not require donor genotyping, and will compete with CareDx’s older test. In recently published studies, Natera demonstrated superior analytical and clinical test performance.”  What happens next remains to be seen, but it’s not the first imbroglio in which Natera finds itself.  A year ago, the gene-testing company Illumina filed a lawsuit against Natera, alleging that the company’s non-invasive prenatal testing infringes a patent that Illumina controls and that relies on analysis of cell-free DNA present in maternal blood. That case is still moving toward a trial . In the meantime, Illumina last year separately won a $26.7 million jury verdict in a lawsuit accusing a subsidiary of Roche Holdings of using patented prenatal testing technology without authorization.  Last year, Natera also agreed to pay $11.4 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. government, after it alleged that Natera submitted false claims to several government health programs based on tips by two former Natera employees who filed an earlier whistleblower lawsuit against the company.  Natera — whose founding CEO, Matthew Rabinowitz, stepped down from his position in January of this year, replaced by longtime Natera employee and COO Steve Chapman — denied the allegations and, as part of the settlement terms, did not admit any wrongdoing.  Either way, Natera, CareDx and Illumina aren’t the only ones duking it out over cell-free DNA testing.  In 2017, for example, Guardant filed a lawsuit against rival Foundation Medicine, alleging that Foundation’s advertising for its own liquid and tissue tests harmed both Guardant and cancer patients by misleading oncologists about the relative accuracy and sensitivity of the competing genomic tests. Foundation later sued Guardant , alleging infringement of a patent that covers methods for analyzing a cancer patient’s tissue or blood sample to detect multiple classes of genomic alterations.  The two companies later settled both without disclosing the terms of their agreement, but Guardant has more recently sued Foundation again . It is also embroiled in an ongoing lawsuit against another rival called Personal Genome Diagnostics over its cell-free DNA technology.

Kate Clark,technology,"                        Unicorns aren’t profitable, and Wall Street doesn’t care     Kate Clark   @kateclarktweets  / 12 hours         In Silicon Valley, investors don’t expect their portfolio companies to be profitable. “Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies,” a bible for founders, instead calls for heavy spending on growth to scale in an Amazon -like fashion.  As for Wall Street, it’s shown an affinity for stock in Jeff Bezos’ business, despite the many years it spent navigating a path to profitability, as well as other money-losing endeavors. Why? Because it too is far less concerned with profitability than market opportunity.  Lyft, a ride-hailing company expected to go public this week, is not profitable. It posted losses of $911 million in 2018, a statistic that will make it the biggest loser amongst U.S. startups to have gone public, according to data collected by The Wall Street Journal . On the other hand, Lyft’s $2.2 billion in 2018 revenue places it atop the list of largest annual revenues for a pre-IPO business, trailing behind only Facebook and Google in that category.  Wall Street, in short, is betting on Lyft’s revenue growth, assuming it will narrow its loses and reach profitability… eventually.  Wall Street’s hungry for unicorns  Lyft, losses notwithstanding, is growing rapidly and Wall Street is paying attention. On the second day of its road show, reports emerged that its IPO was already oversubscribed. As a result, Lyft is said to have upped the cost of its stock, with new plans to raise more than $2 billion at a valuation upwards of $25 billion. That represents a revenue multiple of more than 11x, a step up multiple of more than 1.6x from its most recent private valuation of $15.1 billion and, of course, Wall Street’s insatiable desire for unicorns, profitable or not.   New data from PitchBook exploring the performance of billion-dollar-plus VC exits confirms Wall Street’s leniency toward unprofitable tech companies. Sixty-four percent of the 100+ companies valued at more than $1 billion to complete a VC-backed IPO since 2010 were unprofitable, and in 2018, money-losing startups actually fared better on the stock exchange than money-earning businesses. Moreover, U.S. tech companies that had raised more than $20 million traded up nearly 25 percent of 2018, while the S&P 500 technology sector posted flat returns.  Wall Street is still adapting to the rapid growth of the tech industry; public markets investors, therefore, are willing to deal with negative to minimal cash flows for, well, a very long time.   A tolerance for outsized exits  There’s no doubt Lyft and its much larger competitor, Uber, will go public at monstrous valuations. The two IPOs, set to create a whole bunch of millionaires and return a number of venture capital funds, will provide Silicon Valley a lesson in Wall Street’s tolerance for outsized exits.   Much like a seed-stage investor must bet on a founder’s vision, Wall Street, given a choice of several unprofitable businesses, has to bet on potential market value. Fortunately, this strategy can work quite well. Take Floodgate, for example. The seed fund invested a small amount of capital in Lyft when it was still a quirky idea for ridesharing called Zimride. Now, it boasts shares worth more than $100 million. I’m sure early shareholders in Amazon — which went public as a money-losing company in 1997 — are pretty happy, too.  Ultimately, Wall Street’s appetite for unicorns like Lyft is a result of the shortage of VC-backed IPOs. In 2006, it was the norm for a company to make its stock market debut at 7.9 years old, per PitchBook. In 2018, companies waited until the ripe age of 10.9 years, causing a significant slowdown in big liquidity events and stock sales.  Fund sizes, however, have grown larger and the proliferation of unicorns continues at unforeseen rates. That may mean, eventually, an influx of publicly shared unicorn stock. If that’s the case, might Wall Street start asking more of these startups? At the very least, public market investors, please don’t be swayed by WeWork ‘s eventual stock offering and its “community adjusted EBITDA.” Silicon Valley’s pixie dust can’t be that potent.   Unicorns aren’t special anymore                         ",On Wall Street's leniency toward unprofitable tech companies and outsized exits.,2019-03-26T20:25:50Z,Unicorns aren't profitable -- Wall Street doesn't care,https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/unicorns-arent-profitable-wall-street-doesnt-care/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?w=753,2019-03-26 22:01:47.246655

Pence, speaking at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, noted that the administration will meet this goal “by any means necessary.” He called on NASA to adopt new policies and argued that the space agency would need to embrace “a new mindset that begins with setting bold goals and staying on schedule.” To do that, he said the administration may consider ditching some of NASA’s current contractors — which are currently developing new vehicles to take humans into deep space — and using commercially developed rockets instead. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the Moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” said Pence. “Urgency must be our watch word.”  “Urgency must be our watch word.”  However, Pence offered few clear recommendations and changes that would help to accelerate NASA’s return, apart from potentially switching rockets and contractors. “It was rhetoric about ‘by all means possible’ and ‘we’ll provide the resources necessary’ and ‘leadership is essential,’” John Logsdon, a space policy expert at George Washington University, tells The Verge . “I mean, they’re all good words. But the devil’s in the details.”            A view of the Moon from the International Space Station  Image: NASA    The administration has been very clear about its desire to return humans to the Moon since the beginning of the Trump presidency. In December of 2017, Trump signed his first space policy directive , instructing NASA to send humans back to the Moon. However, NASA has been relatively vague about its timeline for following through on this directive. Recently, the agency came up with 2028 as a placeholder date for the first humans to land on the Moon, and now the administration is expressing its displeasure with that timeline. “Ladies and gentlemen, that’s just not good enough,” Pence said during his speech.  Right now, the space agency’s strategy for getting back to the lunar surface relies on building a space station in orbit around the Moon, called the Gateway. Such a platform would serve as a way station for astronauts to travel to and from the Moon’s surface. Additionally, NASA has been focusing on developing a new monster rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS), which would be used to launch a crew capsule called Orion into deep space. Not only would the SLS send people to the Gateway, but it would also be used to deliver cargo and help bring new modules to the lunar space station. And just recently, NASA called on commercial companies to come up with designs for landers that could transport humans from the Gateway to the Moon.  “Ladies and gentlemen, that’s just not good enough.”  However, NASA does not plan to start building the Gateway until 2022, and doesn’t intend to test out the first human-rate landers on the Moon until the mid-2020s. Additionally, the SLS has suffered from a series of delays and cost overruns that threaten the current unaccelerated timeline. The rocket was originally expected to launch as early as 2017, sending the Orion capsule on a three-week-long trip around the Moon. But the rocket’s debut flight has since been pushed back to June of 2020. And recently, NASA officials admitted that the 2020 date will most likely move to 2021 — a move that apparently angered those within the administration . The delay prompted NASA to consider alternatives for launching Orion in 2020, including using commercially available rockets such as SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy or ULA’s Delta IV Heavy instead of the SLS.            An artistic rendering of the Space Launch System during launch  Image: NASA    However, faced with the charge of meeting the ambitious 2024 deadline, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told Pence that NASA has to have the SLS and “accelerate its agenda.” Rather than use commercial rockets, Bridenstine said that the SLS will be ready for its current launch date. “I am confident we can get to that first launch in 2020 for SLS and actually fly the crew capsule around the Moon,” Bridenstine said, though he did not elaborate on what has changed that would prevent the delay to 2021. Boeing later clarified to The Verge that it plans to deliver the core of the SLS rocket this year, and that it’s been able to accelerate development by coming up with a new plan that will allow the company to work on different sections at the same time, while piecing parts of the rocket together.  “Boeing and NASA have implemented changes in both processes and technologies to accelerate production, without sacrificing safety or quality, and we remain on schedule to deliver the first SLS core stage to NASA by the end of this year,” Boeing said in a statement. However, Boeing did note that it was struggling with flat budgets.  “To me it was a grand speech without any teeth.”  If the SLS does remain an essential part of NASA’s deep-space exploration plans, that means that something else about the agency’s current strategy needs to change. No concrete insights were given about that, though. Pence made it clear that NASA needs a greater sense of urgency and a change in culture, but he did not offer up any guarantees of more funding from the administration. “To me it was a grand speech without any teeth,” Laura Forczyk, a space consultant and owner of space research and consulting firm Astralytical, tells The Verge . “It was another big set of promises.”  In fact, this speech comes at an awkward time, as the president’s recent budget request proposed significantly cutting funding for NASA , including the budgets for SLS and Orion. And NASA officials even admitted after the budget request was released that even more funding may not be enough to accelerate development. “Getting ... to launch as fast as technically possible is a prime objective of this budget, something that more money will not accelerate,” Jeff DeWit, the chief financial officer for NASA, said during a press conference on the budget request in March. “This is a deeply technical condition in terms of getting there faster. So we are not asking for more money for us to do the job. We just need a little more time.”            An artistic rendering of NASA’s Gateway project  Image: NASA    Even if the administration decided to give more money to NASA or significantly change the agency’s plans, the executive branch can’t make those decisions alone. As is the case for all government agencies, any major funding decisions have to be approved by Congress. And when setting the annual budget, lawmakers can also set NASA’s agenda. It’s one of the reasons why the SLS remains a significant part of the space agency’s plans. The rocket is mostly being built out of Alabama — the site of today’s Space Council meeting — and this location has garnered a lot of support for the vehicle from Alabama representatives in Congress, notably Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL). They have strived to keep the rocket alive by giving it extra funding and mandating its development, as it supplies jobs in the state.  “I applaud the call to get on with it.”  So if NASA wants to accelerate its timeline for the Gateway or its deadlines for the completion of lunar landers, Congress must approve it. Granted, Congress has been setting a precedent in recent years for giving NASA more funding than that the president’s budget requests have asked for, so it’s possible lawmakers may provide the necessary cash flow. But until that happens, Pence’s words are just that: words.  During his speech, Pence did invoke the memory of President John F. Kennedy, who made a similar bold declaration to send humans to the Moon without any guarantees from lawmakers. “Some will say it’s too hard, too risky, too expensive,” he said. “But the same was said back in 1962.” Circumstances have changed drastically since the 1960s, and we will find out this year if Congress decides to follow through on Pence’s call to action.  “It is time to go back,” says Logsdon. “So I applaud the call to get on with it.”       Next Up In Science                         Most Read                  Apple announces Apple Card credit card  Coming summer 2019              Europe’s controversial overhaul of online copyright receives final approval  The much-criticized ‘upload filter’ and ‘link tax’ will soon become law in EU nations              The Apple Card is Apple’s thinnest and lightest status symbol ever  There was one hardware announcement at Apple’s services event                 Huawei’s P30 Pro is a photographic powerhouse with a tiny notch  Huge battery, absentee bezels, and a promising new quad-camera system              All the things Apple didn’t tell us about its streaming TV service  Apple TV Plus is more mysterious than familiar                        Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.    email address...

Fifty-three Republicans, three Democrats, and an Independent from Maine voted not to advance the resolution, and 43 Democrats voted ""present,"" essentially taking no official side in the vote.  Further Reading Green New Deal bill aims to move US to 100% renewable energy, net-zero emissions The Green New Deal is a sweeping but non-binding resolution , unofficially committing the United States to radically update its energy grid with renewable energy in a span of 10 years. The plan would be accomplished through major infrastructure projects akin to those seen during the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's time.  The plan, sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) in the Senate and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in the House, has been extraordinarily controversial. It's been panned as ""socialism"" on the right and tacitly disavowed by more moderate Democrats in Republican-leaning states.  The vote was pushed in the Senate by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ken.), who hoped to divide Democrats by forcing them to take a side on the resolution. Per The Hill , McConnell said in a statement today that ""The American people will see, they will see which of their senators can do the commonsense thing and vote no on this destructive socialist daydream. And they will see which senators are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can't even vote 'no' on self-inflicted economic ruin.""  The 43 ""present"" votes from Democrats were essentially protest votes, challenging McConnell's political play. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the vote a ""sham"" hours before it occurred, because Republicans refused to schedule hearings, hear expert testimony, or work on a bipartisan compromise resolution, according to USA Today .  The Hill notes that ""Every Democratic senator running for the party's [presidential] nomination in 2020 has co-sponsored the Senate Green New Deal resolution.""  Although the House could call a vote on the Green New Deal, there are no immediate plans to move forward on it.                reader comments  101  with 59 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit         Megan Geuss Megan is a staff editor at Ars Technica.

Josh Constine,technology,"                        The danger of ‘I already pay for Apple News+’  At the mercy of a new algorithm     Josh Constine   @JoshConstine  / 11 hours         Apple doesn’t care about news, it cares about recurring revenue. That’s why publishers are crazy to jump into bed with Apple News+. They’re rendering their own subscription options unnecessary in exchange for a sliver of what Apple pays out from the mere $10 per month it charges for unlimited reading.  The unfathomable platform risk here makes Facebook’s exploitative Instant Articles program seem toothless in comparison. On Facebook, publishers became generic providers of dumb content for the social network’s smart pipe that stole the customer relationship from content creators. But at least publishers were only giving away their free content.  Apple News+ threatens to open a massive hole in news site paywalls, allowing their best premium articles to escape. Publishers hope they’ll get exposure to new audiences. But any potential new or existing direct subscriber to a publisher will no longer be willing to pay a healthy monthly fee to occasionally access that top content while supporting the rest of the newsroom. They’ll just cherry pick what they want via News+, and Apple will shave off a few cents for the publisher while owning all the data, customer relationship and power.   “Why subscribe to that publisher? I already pay for Apple News+” should be the question haunting journalists’ nightmares. For readers, $10 per month all-you-can-eat from 300-plus publishers sounds like a great deal today. But it could accelerate the demise of some of those outlets, leaving society with fewer watchdogs and storytellers. If publishers agree to the shake hands with the devil, the dark lord will just garner more followers, making its ruinous offer more tempting.  There are so many horrifying aspects of Apple News+ for publishers, it’s best just to list each and break them down.  No relationship with the reader  To succeed, publishers need attention, data and revenue, and Apple News+ gets in the way of all three. Readers visit Apple’s app, not the outlet’s site that gives it free rein to promote conference tickets, merchandise, research reports and other money-makers. Publishers don’t get their Apple News+ readers’ email addresses for follow-up marketing, cookies for ad targeting and content personalization, or their credit card info to speed up future purchases.   At the bottom of articles, Apple News+ recommends posts by an outlet’s competitors. Readers end up without a publisher’s bookmark in their browser toolbar, app on their phone or even easy access to them from News+’s default tab. They won’t see the outlet’s curation that highlights its most important content, or develop a connection with its home screen layout. They’ll miss call-outs to follow individual reporters and chances to interact with innovative new interactive formats.  Perhaps worst of all, publishers will be thrown right back into the coliseum of attention. They’ll need to debase their voice and amp up the sensationalism of their headlines or risk their users straying an inch over to someone else. But they’ll have no control of how they’re surfaced…  At the mercy of the algorithm  Which outlets earn money on Apple News+ will be largely determined by what Apple decides to show in those first few curatorial slots on screen. At any time, Apple could decide it wants more visual photo-based content or less serious world news because it placates users even if they’re less informed. It could suddenly preference shorter takes because they keep people from bouncing out of the app, or more generic shallow-dives that won’t scare off casual readers who don’t even care about that outlet. What if Apple signs up a publisher’s biggest competitor and sends them all the attention, decimating the first outlet’s discovery while still exposing its top paywalled content for cheap access?   Remember when Facebook wanted to build the world’s personalized newspaper and delivered tons of referral traffic, then abruptly decided to favor “friends and family content” while leaving publishers to starve ? Now outlets are giving Apple News+ the same iron grip on their businesses. They might hire a ton of talent to give Apple what it wants, only for the strategy to change. The Wall Street Journal says it’s hiring 50 staffers to make content specifically for Apple News+. Those sound like some of the most precarious jobs in the business right now.  Remember when Facebook got the WSJ, Guardian and more to build “social reader apps” and then one day just shut off the virality and then shut down the whole platform ? News+ revenue will be a drop in the bucket of iPhone sales, and Apple could at any time decide it’s not thirsty any more and let News+ rot. That and the eventual realization of platform risk and loss of relationship with the reader led the majority of Facebook’s Instant Articles launch partners like The New York Times, The Washington Post and Vox to drop the format. Publishers would be wise to come to that same conclusion now before they drive any more eyeballs to News+.  News+ isn’t built for news  Apple acquired the magazine industry’s self-distribution app Texture a year ago. Now it’s trying to cram in traditional text-based news with minimal work to adapt the product. That means National Geographic and Sports Illustrated get featured billing with animated magazine covers and ways to browse the latest “issue.” News outlets get demoted far below, with no intuitive or productive way to skim between articles beyond swiping through a chronological stack.   I only see WSJ’s content below My Magazines, a massive At Home feature from Architectural Digest, a random Gadgets & Gear section of magazine articles, another huge call-out for the new issue of The Cut plus four pieces inside of it, and one more giant look at Bloomberg’s profile of Dow Chemical. That means those magazines are likely to absorb a ton of taps and engagement time before users even make it to the WSJ, which will then only score few cents per reader.  Magazines often publish big standalone features that don’t need a ton of context. News articles are part of a continuum of information that can be laid out on a publisher’s own site where they have control, but not on Apple News+. And to make articles more visually appealing, Apple strips out some of the cross-promotional recirculation, sign-up forms and commerce opportunities on which publishers depend.  Shattered subscriptions  The whole situation feels like the music industry stumbling into the disastrous iTunes download era. Musicians earned solid revenue when someone bought their whole physical album for $16 to listen to the single, then fell in love with the other songs and ended up buying merchandise or concert tickets. Then suddenly, fans could just buy the digital single for $0.99 from iTunes, form a bond with Apple instead of the artist and the whole music business fell into a depression.  Apple News+’s onerous revenue-sharing deal puts publishers in the same pickle. That occasional flagship article that’s a breakout success no longer serves as a tentpole for the rest of the subscription.  Formerly, people would need to pay $30 per month for a WSJ subscription to read that article, with the price covering the research, reporting and production of the whole newspaper. Readers felt justified paying the price because they got access to the other content, and the WSJ got to keep all the money even if people didn’t read much else or declined to even visit during the month. Now someone can pop in, read the WSJ’s best or most resource-intensive article, and the publisher effectively gets paid à la carte like with an iTunes single. Publishers will be scrounging for a cut of readers’ $10 per month, which will reportedly be divided in half by Apple’s oppressive 50 percent cut, then split between all the publishers someone reads — which will be heavily skewed towards the magazines that get the spotlight.  I’ve already had friends ask why they should keep paying if most of the WSJ is in Apple News along with tons of other publishers for a third of the price. Hardcore business news addicts that want unlimited access to the finance content that’s only available for three days in Apple News+ might keep their WSJ subscription. But anyone just in it for the highlights is likely to stop paying WSJ directly — or never start.  I’m personally concerned because TechCrunch has agreed to put its new Extra Crunch $15 per month subscription content inside Apple News+ despite all the warning signs. We’re saving some perks, like access to conference calls just for direct Extra Crunch subscribers, and perhaps a taste of EC’s written content might convince people they want the bonus features. But even more likely seems the possibility that readers would balk at paying again for just some extra perks when they already get the rest from Apple News, and many newsrooms aren’t set up to do anything but write articles.  It’s the “good enough” strategy we see across tech products playing out in news. When Instagram first launched Stories, it lacked a ton of Snapchat’s features, but it was good enough and conveniently located where people already spent their time and had their social graph. Snapchat didn’t suddenly lose all its users, but there was little reason for new users to sign up and growth plummeted.  Apple News is pre-loaded on your device, where you already have a credit card set up, and it’s bundled with lots of content, at a cheaper price than most individual news outlets. Even if it doesn’t offer unlimited, permanent access to every WSJ Pro story, Apple News+ will be good enough. And it gets better with each outlet that allies with this Borg.  But this time, good enough won’t just determine which tech giant wins. Apple News+ could decimate the revenue of a fundamental pillar of society we rely on to hold the powerful accountable. Yet to the journalists that surrender their content, Apple will have no accountability.                        ","Apple doesn’t care about news, it cares about recurring revenue. That’s why publishers are crazy to jump into bed with Apple News+. They’re rendering their own subscription options unnecessary in exchange for a sliver of what Apple pays out from the mere $10 per month it charges f…",2019-03-26T21:55:44Z,"The danger of ""I already pay for Apple News+""",https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/no-need-to-subscribe/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-News-Plus.png?w=753,2019-03-26 22:01:47.246655
Connie Loizos,technology,"                        Former NEA partner Jon Sakoda takes the wraps off his new, Cisco-backed venture fund, Decibel     Connie Loizos   @Cookie  / 9 hours         Jon Sakoda needed to decompress, he says. The founder-turned-venture investor had logged a dozen years with the investing heavyweight New Enterprise Associates after selling his last startup to Symantec in 2006, and what he wanted by last summer was more time with his kids, and less time with his phone, which he turned off for three weeks.  “I can’t recommend it enough,” says Sakoda, who has since returned to work and is today taking the wraps off his new venture firm, Decibel , a term sometimes used to describe exponential changes in the power of sounds or signals sent through a network and which speaks to the “exponential power” of the firm’s network, says its new website.  While it’s tempting to poke fun at this claim, it appears from the outside to be true. Though Sakoda is the sole founding partner of Decibel — he says he’s looking to add investing professionals right now — not only does Decibel have the benefit of his extensive connections in Silicon Valley; it’s also majority backed by Cisco, the network gear maker that’s aggressively transforming itself into more of a software-focused company.  Though Sakoda declines to comment on the exact size of Cisco’s investment or the fund’s overall composition, citing SEC restrictions, he tells us he’s working very collaboratively with the company, including its corporate venture arm, Cisco Investments.  He’s also working with some of the many founders to be swept into Cisco over the years via its brisk M&A strategy. For example, one of these, Jon Oberheide, a founder who sold his company, Duo Security, to Cisco for more than $2 billion last year, is currently working with one of Decibel’s portfolio companies already as an advisor.  Put into context, Oberheide is helping with half of Decibel’s portfolio, which includes the three-year-old, Vancouver-based cybersecurity startup CMD , which last month closed on $15 million in funding led by GV. (It’s this team that Oberheide is helping.) Decibel has also backed Blameless , a developer of software for site reliability engineers that announced $20 million in funding just last week led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.  Sakoda says more deals are in the works, and explains that what he’s shopping for has little overlap with Cisco today, but could eventually be a strategic fit for the corporate giant. For example, though Sakoda was involved in funding Snap on behalf of NEA, he says it’s not so likely he’ll be shopping for e-commerce or media startups for Decibel.  Absent these areas, though Sakoda suggests that anything goes as long as the company isn’t too far along.  “We’re really going to be looking for startups trying to find product market fit and help with how to grow,” he explains. “If a company has lots of revenue and is already scaling, it’s probably too late for us.”  It makes a kind of sense, considering that Decibel itself has a ways to go to establish itself. Though an earlier SEC filing suggests the fund is targeting $500 million , a pool that will be structured like a traditional venture fund (“investments, personnel, and fund governance is all independent” from Cisco, says Sakoda),  and though Decibel already has plans to write checks of between $5 million and $15 million to seed- and Series A-stage companies, ask Sakoda where the firm is based, and he’ll laughingly tell you he doesn’t quite know.  Though Decibel has (and takes advantage of) access to Cisco’s many offices, including six in San Francisco alone, Sakoda says he hasn’t “quite figured that out — yet. I’m working on it.”                        ","Jon Sakoda needed to decompress, he says.

Just turn the whole assembly sideways!    Ron Amadeo - Mar 26, 2019 9:49 pm UTC         reader comments  83  with 53 posters participating    Share this story   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Reddit             Here's the camera assembly for the Huawei P30 Pro and... wait, what? Is that a square camera lens?   Huawei          That under the square cover is a mirror, which allows the whole camera assembly to be horizontal.    Huawei           This gives you an idea of just how much more room Huawei has to work with thanks to the periscope.   Huawei          There is still a camera bump.   Huawei          The front design is pretty standard. There's a notch.   Huawei          The sides of the screen are curved.   Huawei          There's no earpiece. Instead, you get a vibrating screen.   Huawei          It comes in many colors.   Huawei          Here's a crazy case option: this is for scuba diving.   Huawei          Want to really show off your P30 Pro? How about a Swarovski crystal-encrusted gift box and phone case?   Huawei       Huawei officially announced the Huawei P30 Pro smartphone today. While it has a new Huawei-made SoC, an in-screen optical fingerprint reader, and lots of other high-end features, the highlight is definitely the camera's optical zoom, which is up to a whopping 5x. Not digital zoom. Real, optical zoom.  On most high-end smartphones today, like the iPhone XS and Galaxy S10, you'll only ever get a 2X optical zoom. Usually, these exist in an entire second sensor and lens on the back of the phone, giving you a choice between the standard 1x lens or extra 2x lens. The reason you usually don't get large zoom multipliers in smartphones is because zoom lenses take space. Inside a zoom lens is a series of smaller lenses, some of which move inside the lens body to change the focal length. A larger distance between the lenses will get you a higher zoom multiplier, and on real cameras this can reach several feet long .  Space, of course, is at a premium in smartphones. Imagine a smartphone sitting face down, and you would have to fit a vertical stack of the display, the CMOS sensor, and the lens all in about an 8mm height. There is just not a lot of room.  But what if we didn't have to stack all the components vertically? The trick to Huawei's 5x optical zoom is that it uses a periscope design. From the outside, it looks like a normal camera setup, albeit with a funky square camera opening. Internally, though, the components make a 90-degree right turn after the lens cover, and the zoom lens components and CMOS sensor are arranged horizontally. Now instead of having to cram a bunch of lenses and the CMOS chip into 8mm of vertical phone space, we have acres of horizontal phone space to play with. We've seen prototypes of periscope cameras from Oppo, but as far as commercial devices go, the Huawei P30 Pro is the first.  Enlarge  / There are a whole lot of cameras on the back. Huawei / Ron Amadeo  While the optical zoom is the big new camera feature, there are four total cameras on the back of the P30 Pro. A 40MP main camera, a 20MP wide angle, the 8MP 5X telephoto, and a Time of Flight depth-sensing camera. The main 40MP camera uses a 1/1.7 inch-type sensor that, when measured diagonally, would make it 32 percent larger than the 1/2.55 inch-type sensors in the Galaxy S10 or iPhone XS. I believe the largest-ever sensor in a smartphone is still the Nokia 808 Pureview , which had a 1/1.2 inch type.  Further Reading Move over Samsung, Huawei’s foldable smartphone is an absolute stunner Huawei also made a big deal out of the new ""RYYB"" pixel layout in its camera sensor. Normally CMOS sensors are ""RGGB,"" one red pixel, two green, and one blue. By changing the green pixels to yellow, Huawei claims it can capture 40 percent more light, as the yellow filter captures green and red light. Of course, this will make the color wonky, but Huawei claims it can correct for that in software.  The front uses a pretty standard notch design featuring a single 32MP camera in the middle of the screen. The display is a 6.47 inch OLED with curved sides and a 2340×1080 resolution. An optical fingerprint reader is embedded in the display, and you won't find an earpiece anywhere, as that is embedded into the display, too. Huawei doesn't explain the feature much other than to call it ""Huawei Acoustic Display Technology,"" but judging by the video the company put out, it seems like an electromagnet vibrates the screen to produce sound.  The SoC is a Huawei-produced Kirin 980 processor. This is a 7nm chip with two Cortex-A76 based cores running at 2.6GHz, two more running at 1.92GHz, and four 1.8GHz Cortex-A55 cores. You can get a P30 Pro with 6 or 8GB of RAM, and storage options are 128GB, 265GB, or 512GB. The phone has IP68 water and dust resistance, NFC, wireless charging, 40W(!) wired charging, and a 4200mAh battery.  If you want to dive into the Huawei P30 Pro, it's out today and starts at €999 ($1,125).

Taylor Hatmaker,technology,"                        FAA proposal aims to ‘streamline’ regulations for future space launches     Taylor Hatmaker   @tayhatmaker  / 12 hours         On Tuesday, the FAA and Department of Transportation published a proposal that greases the wheels for the commercial space industry, long bound by outdated regulations that were not created with a modern vision of private spaceflight in mind.  Last May, the Trump administration signaled its intention to ease commercial spaceflight regulations with Space Policy Directive 2 . That directive called on Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to “release a new regulatory system for managing launch and re-entry activity.” That system, released in draft form today, seeks to pave the way for an “industry that is undergoing incredible transformation with regulations that have failed to keep up.”  With less than a year of turnaround time, the FAA and DOT produced a document detailing “ Streamlined Launch and Reentry Licensing Requirements ” that will govern commercial space activity. As the document states:  This rulemaking would streamline and increase flexibility in the FAA’s commercial space launch and reentry regulations, and remove obsolete requirements. This action would consolidate and revise multiple regulatory parts and apply a single set of licensing and safety regulations across several types of operations and vehicles. The proposed rule would describe the requirements to obtain a vehicle operator license, the safety requirements, and the terms and conditions of a vehicle operator license.  “These rules will maintain safety, simplify the licensing process, enable innovation, and reduce costs to help our country remain a leader in commercial space launches,” Chao said of the 580-page document, embedded in full below.   View this document on Scribd  The new regulatory guidance comes on the same day that Vice President Mike Pence declared that U.S. astronauts must return to the moon again within the next five years “by any means necessary.” That considerably hastened schedule would upend NASA’s existing timeline for a U.S. return to the moon at 2028 at the soonest.   Trump wants to send astronauts to the Moon on the way to Mars                         ","On Tuesday, the FAA and Department of Transportation published a proposal that greases the wheels for the commercial space industry, long bound by outdated regulations that were not created with a modern vision of private spaceflight in mind.

                        and Bloomberg  March 26, 2019       Attorney General William Barr’s four-page letter to Congress made clear that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russian election interference was exhaustive—generating 500 search warrants, more than 2,800 subpoenas and interviews of 500 witnesses. Barr delivered a verdict on it in 48 hours, leaving many questions unanswered .  Many of those could be revealed when Barr releases a more detailed accounting of Mueller’s probe in a matter of weeks, not months, a Justice Department official said. Democrats are pushing for the release of Mueller’s entire report . In the meantime, here are some of the most pressing:  1. Why didn’t Mueller reach a finding on whether Trump tried to obstruct justice?  This is perhaps the most puzzling aspect of Barr’s letter. According to the attorney general, Mueller didn’t come to a conclusion on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. “While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” Barr quotes Mueller as saying—adding that the special counsel left the decision to Barr , who cleared Trump. A special counsel is appointed in part to conduct an independent investigation, free from conflicts. So the decision to leave it to a Trump appointee and established critic of the obstruction probe is sure to draw questions from Congress.    2. Why did Mueller let Trump submit written answers, rather than sitting for an interview?  Mueller’s team long sought to interview the president. But in November, Trump’s lawyers submitted written responses to Mueller’s questions about the period before Trump became president, and about Russia-related topics. Trump declined to provide answers to questions related to his time as president or those concerning obstruction of justice.  Mueller could have subpoenaed Trump, a move that would have forced the president to choose between the potential legal risk of being interviewed under oath or the political risk of declining and taking the Fifth or claiming executive privilege. Did Mueller make a political concession to protect his investigation from Trump’s wrath? Democrats are certain to pursue this question.  3. Without interviewing the president, how is it possible to make a decision about obstruction of justice?  In his letter, Barr says prosecutors need to satisfy three legal questions to charge a person with obstruction. Did Trump have corrupt intent? Did he engage in obstructive conduct? And, did that affect a pending or contemplated proceeding? Barr said that Mueller wasn’t able to reach the legal threshold on any of those questions. But Democrats will surely want to know how they reached such a conclusion without interviewing Trump.   4. Barr’s letter suggests some instances of potential obstruction weren’t made public. Are there any clues about what they are?  Not in Barr’s letter. However, several elements of a potential obstruction case against Trump are well known. They include former FBI Director James Comey’s claim that Trump asked him to “let this go”—referring to the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn—followed by Comey’s May 2017 firing. There was also Trump’s drafting of a misleading memo for his son to give the New York Times about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russians. In his letter, however, Barr said “most” of the obstruction claims had been the subject of public reporting. Mueller’s report could fill in the blanks.  5. Whom did Mueller’s team interview?  As of February 2018, Trump lawyer John Dowd wrote that 20 White House officials had provided information to Mueller’s team, and 17 campaign staff members had spoken to the special counsel or congressional investigators, according to the Washington Post . That’s far short of the overall 500 witnesses that the special counsel’s office interviewed, according to Barr. Many of those names are likely to remain secret.    6. How wide-ranging is Mueller’s report?  It may be far from exhaustive, at least judging by Barr’s summary. Even its length is unclear. The attorney general says the report is divided into two parts. First are the results of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections. Second is a discussion of the actions by Trump “related to Russian election interference” that could raise obstruction of justice concerns.  The Russian interference component, in Barr’s telling, consists of two efforts that Mueller has already narrated in public charges—alleged disinformation operations by a Russian troll farm, and a Russian government-led hacking operation to steal and spread Democrats’ emails to influence the election. Mueller asked whether any Americans, including those in the Trump campaign, joined in. What’s unclear is whether Mueller focused narrowly on whether Americans aided those two efforts specifically, or if his report outlines investigations that veer outside those lines.    7. What conclusions did Mueller draw from the Trump campaign’s apparent discussions regarding sanctions relief and Ukraine that would be favorable to the Kremlin—at a time when Trump was negotiating to build a Trump Tower in Moscow?  Because Barr says the “principal conclusions” of Mueller’s report center on the two Russian cyber-efforts to influence the election, it leaves open the question of whether there are secondary conclusions, and how extensive those might be. There’s no direct indication in Barr’s letter that the report could delve into Russian-American interactions that weren’t related to those two efforts. There’s also no indication that Mueller’s report would cover, say, any discussions over post-election U.S. policy.  8. What unreported lines of investigation did Mueller spin off?  Barr notes that the special counsel referred several matters to other authorities. Some are known, such as a campaign-finance investigation that’s now being undertaken by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and has led to the sentencing of ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Are there others?  9. What was Mueller’s standard of proof?  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required for a conviction in a criminal case. Barr says he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein applied that standard in determining that Trump didn’t obstruct justice. But lawmakers aren’t bound by such a high standard of proof in their investigations, and may have another view on what Barr said was Mueller’s other main revelation—that he “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.”    10. What evidence did Mueller gather about the Trump team’s efforts to establish a back channel with Russia?  Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a senior adviser, and Michael Flynn, then an adviser on national security, both discussed setting up a secret channel of communications with influential Russians during the campaign and transition, according to media reports. During the president’s first month in office, Erik Prince, an informal Trump adviser, reportedly met with the Russian Direct Investment Fund in the Seychelles. What did Mueller’s team learn about the purpose of that meeting and the administration’s alleged efforts to sidestep normal diplomatic channels? How many of those episodes ultimately fell within Mueller’s purview?  11. What about the infamous Trump Tower meeting?  Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Kushner, and others met on June 9, 2016, with a Russian lawyer who they believed would give “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Did Mueller learn more about that meeting than has already been made public?    12. What did Mueller conclude about then-Trump campaign chairman Manafort’s campaign-season meeting with a Russian suspected of ties to the country’s intelligence service?  Manafort met Konstantin Kilimnik—his longtime associate, whom authorities have linked to Russian intelligence—at an upscale Manhattan cigar bar on Aug. 2, 2016. That much is known from filings in Manafort’s case, which also indicate that Manafort handed Kilimnik polling data from the Trump campaign. But key details of the events remain blacked out in court filings. A Mueller prosecutor said the meeting went to the “heart” of the special counsel’s investigation. Just how it does so is a mystery the full report may answer.  13. What did Mueller conclude about longtime Trump ally Roger Stone’s interactions regarding WikiLeaks?  Starting in June 2016, anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks began publishing Democratic emails that Mueller has said were stolen by Russian hackers. Stone told Trump campaign officials that he had information about WikiLeaks releasing documents that would be damaging to Clinton, according to prosecutors. Trump campaign officials allegedly pressed Stone to find out when more dumps of Clinton material would be coming. And Stone used Twitter to contact Guccifer 2.0, which Mueller said was an alias for the Russian intelligence officers who stole the emails.    There was speculation that Stone could have been a conduit to WikiLeaks—but no direct connection has been established. (Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges he lied to congressional investigators about the matter and engaged in witness tampering.)  14. What happened to the draft charges against Jerome Corsi, the political gadfly who allegedly acted as an intermediary between Stone and WikiLeaks?  Mueller’s team was said to have offered Corsi a deal in which he would have pleaded guilty to perjury over statements he made about his interactions with WikiLeaks. He refused, gave copies of the draft agreement to the news media and ridiculed Mueller’s investigation in interviews. Because Corsi wasn’t charged, details about the investigation of him may remain under wraps.  15. Will we ever know if Russia’s sabotage attempts swayed the 2016 election?  It’s hard to know if Mueller addressed this question. One problem is that it’s hard to measure the impact of disparate social media campaigns and the flood of hacked Democratic emails, though they surely hurt Clinton’s campaign.  16. Did Mueller recommend ways to prevent foreign interference in future U.S. elections?  Mueller already laid out, in indictments last year, the two alleged conspiracies by the Russian government to disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections. That gave his team access to a wide range of grand jury testimony and other confidential material that could inform the U.S.’s actions to prevent future attacks on the electoral system.

AP Photo/Tony Avelar                     Apple must be prepared to shoulder huge losses to succeed in the TV business. On Monday, the tech giant announced Apple TV Plus, its entry into the streaming TV market. The company is used to enjoying huge profits on the sales of the iPhone, its star product — but entertainment is very different. Apple needs to have the appetite to spend enormous sums for years — without generating much revenue in return — to make a dent in showbiz. It's official: Apple is going to Hollywood. But if it's going to survive, it needs to realise that Tinseltown is nothing like Silicon Valley. On Tuesday, the Cupertino technology giant held a glitzy event to formally announce its long-awaited video-streaming service, Apple TV Plus. When it launches, it will offer subscribers original content, including TV shows, movies and documentaries — and it has some of the biggest names in showbiz on board, from Steven Spielberg to Oprah Winfrey and JJ Abrams. But it's also going up against long-established players like HBO and Netflix, and will need to adopt a totally new approach to doing business if it wants to make Apple TV Plus a long-term success. Apple's business, at present, is heavily dependent on the ongoing success of the iPhone. It's the world's most popular smartphone, and is a money-printing machine of staggering proportions. Apple enjoys quarterly profits of $20 billion , largely off the back of the ongoing success of iPhone. Every device sold means hundreds of dollars in profit for Apple, which stands in stark contrast to the razor-thin margins in much of the rest of the smartphone business. The media business is not going to be the same immediate cash-generating success for Apple. It is facing the necessity of enormous outlays to procure top tier talent and produce new video content from scratch, with no guarantee of success. Apple TV Plus may be in the red for years before it hits a critical mass of users to make it sustainable on its own merits. Such profligate spending is necessary because without the content there in the first place, users simply won't pay to sign up. You wouldn't sign up for a paid streaming service with only three shows and a dozen movies — there needs to be a key level of content before the entire enterprise even becomes viable. That means burning cash lots of cash. Apple has some key strengths going into this: Hundreds of millions of users, and bucketloads of moolah. Morgan Stanley weighs in As Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note to clients on Tuesday: ""Apple enters the content publishing business with two distinct strengths — a global user base and a massive checkbook. In our view, these two factors alone mean investors and competitors should take it seriously."" As such, the determining factor in Apple's success may not be whether it can afford to persevere, but rather whether it has the stomach to do so — if that means subsidizing unprecedented losses in an uncertain new business vertical until it builds the ""content tonnage needed"" to achieve scale,"" wrote the analysts. Morgan Stanley points to the volume of cash Netflix had to go through to reach its position of strength: ""From 2012 to 2021, when we estimated Netflix turns [free cash flow] positive, we estimate it will have burned nearly $13bn of [free cash flow to achieve this feat ... Netflix has benefited from a long bull market and fairly easy access to capital. Does Apple have the appetite to spend its way to success?""  This is a subscriber-only story.

Reuters          The special counsel Robert Mueller's work is over, but his investigation's end does not mean President Donald Trump's legal woes are done. House Democrats have taken a keen interest in digging deeper into Trump's finances, using clues from the Mueller probe and investigations by federal prosecutors in New York. Among other issues, House Democrats are zeroing in on obtaining Trump's tax returns while scrutinizing the Trump Organization and the president's inaugural committee. Prosecutors investigating President Donald Trump and his finances left a trail of breadcrumbs that House Democrats are picking up on after the special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his work on the Russia investigation last week. Mueller was tasked with investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor. Encompassed in that investigation was the FBI's counterintelligence inquiry into whether Trump is acting as a Russian agent. As part of the counterintelligence probe, Mueller's team was known to have examined Trump's business dealings to determine whether he had any financial interests related to Russia that could affect his ability to conduct US policy. Trump maintains that he has no financial links to Russia. ""I don't make money from Russia,"" he said in 2017. Read more : Here's a glimpse at Trump's decades-long history of business ties to Russia The comment appears to stand in contrast to those made by Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., in a 2008 New York Times op-ed . The younger Trump wrote, ""In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets ... We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" Eric Trump said the same to a reporter . He later backtracked and said the Trump Organization's funding came as a result of ""incredible cash flow."" Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press Federal prosecutors probe Trump Organization, Trump Tower Moscow negotiations, and the Trump inaugural committee Mueller's team demonstrated an interest in the Trump Organization when prosecutors subpoenaed documents from the company last year. Most significantly, prosecutors also asked several witnesses about the Trump Organization's negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Those negotiations took place at the height of the 2016 campaign, and Justice Department veterans told INSIDER that prosecutors likely asked about the project to gauge whether there was any quid pro quo in which the Trump campaign offered to soften the US's stance toward Russia in exchange for the Kremlin's approval for the project. Then there's the lingering mystery of why Alfa-Bank, one of the largest banks in Russia, was looking up the address of the Trump Organization's computer server nearly every day during the 2016 campaign. Between May and September 2016, Alfa-Bank looked up the Trump Organization's domain more than 2,000 times, according to The New Yorker.

Michael Cohen. AP Photo/Julie Jacobson Cohen pleaded guilty to several counts of tax evasion, bank fraud, and campaign-finance violations as part of the SDNY's investigation. While Trump was not specifically named in the charging document, he is widely believed to be the person whom prosecutors referred to as ""Individual-1"" in the court filing, which legal experts say makes the president an unindicted coconspirator. New York federal prosecutors have also recently signaled an interest in Trump's inaugural committee. Cohen is still cooperating with prosecutors in the SDNY's investigation, as well as other ongoing criminal inquiries. But he shed more light on Trump's financial dealings during a blockbuster hearing before the House Oversight Committee last month. Read more : The 8 biggest takeaways from Michael Cohen's blockbuster testimony against Trump In addition to implicating Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, in ""garden variety financial fraud"" related to the hush-money payments, Cohen also said it was possible Trump may have inflated or deflated the value of his financial assets for insurance and tax purposes. Rep. Jerrold Nadler in 2007. Reuters 'We're not leaving any stone unturned' House Democrats have seized on Mueller's and the SDNY's findings, as well as Cohen's testimony, to launch a sprawling inquiry into every aspect of Trump's life: his campaign, his business, his defunct charity, his personal affairs, his inaugural committee, and more. House Democrats have also zeroed in on Trump's tax returns , which have still not been made public. ""We're not leaving any stone unturned,"" one congressional aide on the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting the investigation, told INSIDER on Tuesday. This person added that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler believes getting Mueller's full report on the Russia investigation — as opposed to Attorney General William Barr's concise summary — is crucial to determining the motivations behind the myriad contacts between Trump associates and Russians, as well as why Trump has shown deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the campaign. Read more : Mueller turned his final report in to Attorney General William Barr, but the Russia probe is nowhere near finished House Democrats are not limited by the same rules as the special counsel's office, and unlike prosecutors in New York, they do not face any jurisdictional constraints. Rep. Adam Schiff. Getty Images In early February, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced a sweeping probe into the president's finances, including potential ties to Russia but also well beyond that — including possible money laundering by the Trump Organization. ""Our job involves making sure that the policy of the United States is being driven by the national interest, not by any financial entanglement, financial leverage or other form of compromise,"" Schiff said in announcing the expansive investigation. Schiff and other top Democrats are looking into why German-based Deutsche Bank was willing to lend the Trump Organization money for many years, even as other banks had turned it down. ""The concern about Deutsche Bank is that they have a history of laundering Russian money,"" Schiff said in December . ""And this, apparently, was the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization.""

Skedulo          Six years after its founding in Australia, Skedulo has offices in three continents and 60,000 people using its service. The startup charges companies a monthly per-user fee to help them manage remote workers. Skedulo recently raised $28 million from investors, including Microsoft's M12 venture arm. For many workers, a 9-to-5 office job is a thing of the past — if they ever experienced it at all. A large and growing number of people work remotely or out in the field, at least some of the time. Managing such a decentralized workforce can be a logistical nightmare, particularly as the number of remote workers a company employs grows larger. But a San Francisco startup has created a service that's designed to ease managers' pain. Skedulo offers an online scheduling service that allows companies to manage remote workers, keeping track of their hours, directing them to particular clients or customers, and providing them a means to send information, such as electronic signatures, back to the home office. The company offers a version of the service that corporate administrators can use back at headquarters and a mobile app for the remote workers themselves. ""For most people, we've become the operating system for their day,"" Matt Fairhurst, Skedulo's CEO, told Business Insider in a recent interview. Skedulo's service is replacing paper and white boards Although the remote workforce has been exploding in recent years across many industries, there haven't been many good technological solutions for companies to manage their off-site workers, Fairhurst said. Many companies that have adopted Skedulo's service were previously using Excel spreadsheets, calendar apps, custom software they created themselves, and even white boards and paper, he said. Read more: 9 traditional fields that are hiring more remote workers than ever ""This is a brand new category from a technology perspective,"" Fairhurst, who also cofounded the company, said. ""It's actually rarely the case that we're going in and ripping out alternative applications that were used to manage this process."" Skedulo helps managers match up remote workers who have particular skills with customers in need of that expertise. Its service can do that automatically for certain companies or industries where that's a good match, Fairhurst said. Or it can just make it easier for managers to manually make those pairings in cases where automation isn't the best solution, he said. ""We're not assuming every company can deploy full optimization or automation all the time,"" he said. ""But it is a really important part of what we do."" Skedulo's service, for which it charges customers a monthly per-user fee, hooks into other kinds of enterprises and management software and services, including Workday, ServiceNow, and Salesforce. It also can be customized and configured for particular industries. It's being used to schedule insurance auditors and clowns The company, which was founded in 2013 in Australia, has about 60,000 people using its service in countries and areas including Australia, the US, and Europe, Fairhurst said. Although Skedulo's service is used across several different industries, it's found particularly strong uptake in the home healthcare business, he said. Such companies represent more than 30% of Skedulo's customer base, he said. But the company has also seen strong adoption in the business-services sector and in training and education, he said. ""We've done everything from help companies schedule clowns to go into a hospital to juggle for sick kids all way to insurance auditors doing claims management in the field,"" Fairhurst said. With the remote workforce continuing to grow, the company sees a big opportunity ahead of it. And investors do, too. Earlier this month, Skedulo closed a $28 million Series B funding round that was led by M12, the name of Microsoft's in-house venture fund. The money, which brought the company's total funding to $40.5 million, gave it a valuation of more than $100 million, according to PitchBook. Skedulo, which has about 120 employees, plans to use the funds to bulk up its sales and marketing teams, which are mainly based in San Francisco, and its product and engineering teams, which are in Brisbane, Australia, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Fairhurst said. ""We want to make sure we're building a team to support the demand we're seeing in the market,"" he said. Skedulo has an ""audacious mission,"" he continued, ""of touching every desk-less and mobile worker."" Got a tip about a startup or other tech company?

After that year, individual EU-member states will have to decide whether they stick with DST or standard time.  Daylight saving time is when we roll clocks back one hour so the sun rises and sets at a later time in the day. Some of the ideas behind the century-old practice of switching to DST include having more daylight working hours and saving energy, but some recent studies have shown that modern-day time changes don’t do much for energy bills or the environment. However, changing time twice a year does seem to have an impact on public health, with people reporting more sleep problems and auto accidents becoming more common after the biannual time shift.    While Daylight Saving Time used to switch at the same time, Europe and the United States change the clocks at different times of the year thanks to new rules enacted in 2007 by President George W. Bush. But if enough Americans are as fed up with turning the clocks backwards and forwards every spring and fall, time changes could be a thing of the past in the U.S. as well. States and territories including Arizona, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, have already opted out of Daylight Saving Time. And President Donald Trump has tweeted his support for permanent Daylight Saving Time , which has been suggested in legislation introduced by Florida lawmakers.

The logistics and delivery giant is partnering with Matternet , a drone-logistics startup, to shuttle medical samples among scattered facilities at WakeMed . The 941-bed hospital system includes three full-service hospitals and other facilities in North Carolina’s Triangle area.  “Currently, the majority of medical samples and specimens are transported across WakeMed’s expanding health system by courier cars,” UPS said in a statement. “The addition of drone transport provides an option for on-demand and same-day delivery, the ability to avoid roadway delays, increase medical delivery efficiency, lower costs and improve the patient experience with potentially life-saving benefits.”    The drone deliveries that began Tuesday are part of a pilot program that the Federal Aviation Administration launched last August to test practical applications of drones and analyze how they could be used safely to speed deliveries and reduce costs. UPS and Matternet are also working with North Carolina’s Department of Transportation to conduct the drone flights.  “Today’s flight marks the beginning of numerous planned daily revenue flights at the WakeMed Raleigh campus,” UPS said.  During the program, WakeMed medical workers will load drones with medical specimens such as a blood sample and send it flying along predetermined flight paths to WakeMed’s central pathology labs, all while monitored by remote drone pilots. Data from those flights will help the companies work on similar drone logistics projects at other hospitals.  UPS has previously partnered with Zipline to deliver blood products to remote locations in Rwanda. Matternet has built an autonomous drone network in Switzerland that delivered blood tests and other samples between medical facilities there.

Southwest Airlines Flight 8701, a Boeing 737 Max 8, was en route from Orlando to Victorville, California, when its pilots declared an emergency minutes after takeoff, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement to Business Insider. Southwest Airlines told Business Insider that its pilots ""reported a performance issue with one of the engines."" The engine issue reported by the pilots appears to be unrelated to the control-software issues that have plagued the 737 Max and that may have contributed to the crashes of both Lion Air Flight JT610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302. Neither of the two ongoing crash investigations have indicated any performance issues with the plane's CFM International Leap-1B engines. The FAA said it is investigating the flight that lasted just 11 minutes . Southwest Airlines, which is based in Dallas, is the single largest operator of the Boeing 737 Max. Read more : Here are the airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max The plane involved in the incident is one of 34 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the Southwest fleet that were grounded by an FAA emergency order earlier this month after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302 . Flight 8701 was headed for the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, where the plane will be kept in short-term desert storage. As a result, there were no passengers on board the flight. ""The Boeing 737 MAX 8 will be moved to our Orlando maintenance facility for a review,"" Southwest said in a statement. Read more : The Boeing 737 Max is likely to be the last version of the best-selling airliner of all time At the heart of the controversy surrounding the 737 Max is MCAS, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. To fit the Max's larger, more fuel-efficient engines, Boeing had to position the engine farther forward and up. This change disrupted the plane's center of gravity and caused the Max to have a tendency to tip its nose upward during flight, increasing the likelihood of a stall. MCAS is designed to automatically counteract that tendency and point the nose of the plane downward. Initial reports from the Lion Air investigation, however, indicate that a faulty sensor reading may have triggered MCAS shortly after the flight took off. Observers fear Ethiopian Airlines flight may have experienced a similar issue. Read more : 53% American adults say they don't want to fly on a Boeing 737 Max Boeing is working on a software update for MCAS along with hardware improvements to get its plane flying again. Here is the FAA's statement in its entirety: ""The crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 8701 , a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, declared an emergency after the aircraft experienced a reported engine problem while departing from Orlando International Airport in Florida about 2:50 p.m. today. The aircraft returned and landed safely in Orlando. No passengers were aboard the aircraft, which was being ferried to Victorville, Calif., for storage. The FAA is investigating.""

And health insurers are worried.  A groundswell of support for Medicare for All among prominent Democratic presidential contenders has spooked the industry, with some candidates professing the private health insurance sector may (and even should) eventually be tossed into the dustbin of history.  Sen. Bernie Sanders—author of a comprehensive Medicare for All bill—has never shied away from a fight with large corporations, and universal health care has long been one of his hobbyhorses. But candidates occupying a more centrist space in the Democratic Party, such as Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cory Booker, have all cosponsored Sanders’s legislation.        The bulk of the Sanders bill would be paid for by a 7.5% payroll tax on employers and 4% from workers’ paychecks. The current system of Medicare and Medicaid would be scrapped and replaced with a significantly more generous program. Everyone in the United States would be covered, no opt in or out.    The big catch: You’d lose your current employer plan. “The Medicare for All bills proposed by Sanders … would effectively eliminate the role of private health insurance providers,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president for health reform at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told Fortune in an interview. “The idea of eliminating an industry and companies that are this large is unprecedented.”  Under the plan, private insurers would be banned from competing with government coverage, relegating them to the role of selling supplemental insurance—table scraps compared with the $600 billion feast that private insurance is today.  Democratic politicians are finding themselves increasingly comfortable with that situation. Harris told CNN’s Jake Tapper, “Let’s eliminate all of that,” referring to the insurance industry (she later softened her stance). Gillibrand has called it an “urgent goal.”              Gillibrand & Harris: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Sanders: Win McNamee—Getty Images      Wall Street is taking that possibility seriously. The S&P 500 Managed Health Care Index, comprising many health insurance stocks, fell 10% between Feb. 26, when House Democrats introduced their own Medicare for All legislation, and March 7. By comparison, the index was up nearly 15% in the 12 months preceding the bill’s introduction.    It’s hard to overstate the magnitude of such an overhaul. UnitedHealth was ranked fifth on the 2018 Fortune 500 list, grossing more than $226 billion last year; Anthem and Aetna (premerger with CVS) were both in the top 50. Those three companies alone employed more than 364,000 people in 2017.  The prospect of all of that simply vanishing has the industry preparing for a fight. Last year the nation’s largest hospital, pharmaceutical, insurance, and doctors’ lobbying groups formed the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), an organization dedicated to market-based health care reforms—and pushing back on the specter of Medicare for All.  “We want to build upon the system that’s working and fix what’s wrong,” Lauren Crawford Shaver, PAHCF’s executive director, told Fortune in an interview. “In many of these Medicare for All proposals, it’s very unclear what they actually want to do. They’re looking to start all over. Why not pause for a second and improve what we have?” Shaver points to polls showing that Americans’ support of Medicare for All, which is 71% if told it would guarantee health care as a right, falls to 37% when told it would eliminate private health insurance.    Subscribe to Fortune’s Brainstorm Health newsletter for daily analysis of the health care industry.  But insurers for the most part haven’t offered up a whole lot of suggestions for fixing the current private system and feel little need to, according to KFF’s Levitt. “Right now, I’d expect health insurers to just trash the idea of Medicare for All without offering an alternative,” he said.  That could be a miscalculation. The cost of private insurance has been rising consistently , and employers have increasingly shifted costs onto their workers—while wages have largely not kept pace.  Those financial realities and the frustrating, jigsaw nature of U.S. health care are fueling the enthusiasm for Medicare for All.  The Sanders bill has a zero probability of passing before 2021. But in a scenario where Democrats win the White House and total control of Congress in 2020 (and nix the Senate filibuster), it’s not in the realm of fantasy that some form of Medicare for All could pass.    Falling short, Democratic leaders would still be likely to push for expanded access to Medicare (by lowering the enrollment age to 55, for example).  If insurers can’t offer a compelling alternative to calm the swell, they could soon find themselves fighting against an industry-drowning tide.

The nonbinding resolution, which calls on the United States to make an ambitious effort to slash its use of fossil fuels to fight climate change, fell short in a procedural vote. The Senate did not proceed to debating the measure, as 57 senators voted against it and 43 Democrats and independents who caucus with them — nearly all of the Democratic caucus — voted ""present."" Four senators who vote with Democrats — Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama and independent Angus King of Maine — voted against the resolution.  By voting ""present,"" Democrats hoped not to go on the record on a bill that had no realistic chance of passing, even if they support the concept of a Green New Deal. The six Democratic senators running for president next year — who co-sponsored the original resolution introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. — did not take a position on the measure Tuesday.   Democrats have pushed for drastic action to combat climate change as the planet warms and severe weather events such as recent Midwestern flooding have devastated U.S. communities. They say the U.S. has only a limited window to combat climate change and address an existential threat.  Republicans have gleefully criticized the Green New Deal, warning about Democratic efforts to take away anything from cars to hamburgers. They accuse Democrats of a drift toward socialism spurred in part by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a champion of the measure in the House.       Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, center, speaks to members of the media while departing a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, March 26, 2019.   Ahead of the vote Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of using political theater to hide his lack of a plan to address a warming planet.  ""Republicans want to force this political stunt to distract from the fact that they neither have a plan nor a sense of urgency to deal with the threat of climate change. With this exercise, the Republican majority has made a mockery of the legislative process,"" the New York Democrat said Tuesday.  McConnell aimed to put Democrats on the record about whether they support the plan. He sees it as something that will fail to resonate with centrist or independent voters, who some senators will need to keep their seats — or win swing states in a presidential election next year.  The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday that he believes in climate change and wants to address it through unspecified ""technology and innovation.""  ""This is nonsense,"" McConnell said of the Green New Deal. ""And if you're going to sign on to nonsense, you ought to have to vote for nonsense.""  President Donald Trump, meanwhile, plans to use the proposal against Democrats as he runs for re-election next year. Six Democratic senators — Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — are running to challenge the president next year.  During a Senate Republican policy lunch Tuesday, Trump signaled he wants to use the Green New Deal as a cudgel in 2020, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham.  ""He said make sure you don't kill it too much, because I want to run against it,"" the South Carolina Republican said, according to NBC News.

Jay Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, addresses the 34th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, April 17, 2018.   WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has nominated U.S. Air Force General John ""Jay"" Raymond to lead the U.S. Space Command, a new combatant command that will oversee the military's missions and war fighting in space.   As the Air Force's top space officer, Raymond was long-considered a favorite for the job. He is currently the commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate for this newly established role, Raymond will run both U.S. Space Command and Air Force Space Command.  The latest revelation comes as the Pentagon works to lay the groundwork for Trump's proposed Space Force, a new sister service branch that would stand alongside the Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force. However, the creation of a sixth military branch, the first in 72 years, is dependent upon congressional approval.   Unlike the creation of a Space Force, the Pentagon can establish a U.S. Space Command without input from lawmakers.  Meanwhile, the Defense Department is asking for $14.1 billion in its fiscal 2020 budget request to fund space operations . The $14.1 billion would allocate funding to several national security programs, from satellites to missile warning systems. Of the total, about $1.6 billion will fund improvements to space-based missile warning capabilities, a missing link in America's layered missile defense system.  The Air Force is also seeking $72.4 million to establish a headquarters for Space Force.

In late February, Boeing said it was investigating a nylon, one-foot noose that was found hanging in a Charleston, S.C., plant that manufactures its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The noose was first reported by a CBS transportation reporter, who confirmed the investigation on Twitter.      #breaking  @weareboeingsc confirms a noose was found at Charleston plant that builds the 787. “I am saddened and angered that a racially-charged symbol was discovered on site…there is absolutely no place for racism and these cowardly acts” VP Brad Zaback wrote in msg to staff.  — Kris Van Cleave (@krisvancleave) March 1, 2019       “We have completed a thorough review of the matter and identified the responsible person,” Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of Boeing’s 787 program said in a letter to the plant’s employees Tuesday. “This individual’s actions are a violation of our company’s values and behaviors, and as a result this individual is no longer with the company.”  Nooses have appeared in several U.S. workplaces in recent years. In January, workers at General Motors  sued the company to address nooses hung in a Toledo, Ohio, plant along with swastikas and racist slogans scrawled in the facility’s restrooms. Earlier this month, UPS workers at a Ohio distribution hub also sued their employer over racist behavior at the site, including the hanging of a noose and a Confederate flag.   The firing at Boeing comes as the aerospace giant weathers a crisis involving its Max 737 planes, two of which have crashed in the last six months, one in Indonesia and another in Egypt. Both planes appear to have been affected by a software program that pushed the plane’s nose downward during flights. Many airlines have grounded their 373 Max planes, with some cancelling orders for new Boeing airplanes.

Saheli Roy Choudhury   Published 31 Mins Ago  CNBC.com              Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images   McDonald's will no longer take part in efforts to lobby against raising the minimum wage at the federal, state or local level, the fast-food giant told the National Restaurant Association, Politico reported .   Genna Gent, McDonald's vice president of U.S. government relations, said in a letter to the association that the company believes wage increases ""should be phased in and that all industries should be treated the same way.""  ""The conversation about wages is an important one; it's one we wish to advance, not impede,"" Gent wrote, according to Politico. The fast-food chain also stated that outlets owned by the company have an average starting wage that exceeds $10 per hour while franchisees pay ""likely similar"" wages in their own restaurants.   McDonald's did not immediately respond to CNBC's emailed requests for comments.  The move from McDonald's, one of the largest employers in the world, could boost House Democrats and their efforts to raise the minimum wage . Earlier this month, the House Committee on Education and Labor advanced a bill to raise the U.S. wage floor to $15 per hour by 2024. Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25.  Still, the legislation has only a slim chance of becoming law. Republicans in the GOP-held Senate — like their colleagues in the House — will likely oppose it. The White House has also trashed the idea of hiking the federal wage floor.  For its part, McDonald's has been mired in a suit over alleged labor violations by some of its franchisees, after they allegedly punished some of their employees who took part in protests to raise the minimum wage, Politico said.

The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions. A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds.      Dawn Giel   Published 5 Hours Ago  Updated  3 Hours Ago  CNBC.com              CNBC San Juan, Puerto Rico.   WASHINGTON — A former top broker in Puerto Rico for the Swiss banking giant UBS was sentenced to a year and a day in prison Tuesday, months after he pleaded guilty to criminal bank fraud for pocketing $1 million in commissions in a scheme that saw many investors lose their life savings.   Jose Ramirez will be the first former UBS Puerto Rico employee to serve jail time for a role in the scheme, which centered on sales of the firm's proprietary closed-end bond funds.  In a near-empty courtroom in DC federal court, Ramirez asked Judge Thomas F. Hogan for leniency.   ""I'm not here to blame anyone else,"" Ramirez, a 60-year-old father of three, told the judge. ""I ruined my record, my life and the lives of those who looked up to me.""  The sentence was shorter than the 33-month maximum recommended by the government. Judge Hogan also ordered two years of supervised release, a $500 fine and granted Ramirez's request to voluntarily report to prison.  ""I'm faced with a human being who has admitted his wrongdoings, and I think is remorseful for his actions,"" Judge Hogan said.  Ramirez, who is known to many in Puerto Rico as ""The Whopper"" pleaded guilty in November 2018 for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and misuse credit lines to purchase securities.  ""UBS terminated the employment of Mr. Ramirez in January 2014, following an internal investigation that determined (1) he had permitted or encouraged clients to engage in improper conduct, and (2) had provided misleading responses to firm management when questioned about it,"" Peter Stack, a spokesman for UBS, said in an emailed statement  According to the government, from January 2011 through September 2013, Ramirez advised his clients to improperly borrow money in order to invest in UBS Puerto Rico bond funds. The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions.     'Broken Bonds'   The use of the credit lines to purchase securities was not allowed by UBS Puerto Rico. However, Ramirez contends that he was not the only broker whose clients used the loans to purchase securities. He alleges in his sentencing memorandum that UBS ""was fully aware of the transactions"" and ""issued letters to at least seven financial advisors for knowing, allowing, or encouraging"" the scheme.  Ramirez has been the only person prosecuted for the involvement in the scheme to date. The sales generated commissions when the credit lines were drawn down at UBS's Utah subsidiary and then again when the clients used the money to invest in the closed end funds managed by Ramirez.  These highly levered funds were chock full of Puerto Rico bonds. By the end of June 2013, two separate bonds accounted for more than 90 percent of the net assets in 10 of UBS funds.  At its peak, UBS had the largest wealth management business in Puerto Rico, representing an estimated 20,000 households.  A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds sold to residents on the island, even as the values of the funds plummeted.  By 2012, UBS investors on the island had about $10 billion invested in the funds, or roughly 10 percent of the island's gross domestic product .  In 2013, the bottom fell out of the Puerto Rico bond market, which caused a steep drop in the value of the bond funds. Many customers were forced to sell their bonds funds because they had no other available assets to meet account maintenance calls. That created significant losses.  According to the government, the market collapse ultimately exposed Ramirez's scheme.  Later that year, in August, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority permanently barred him from acting as a broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm after he failed to cooperate with regulators during his on-the-record testimony. According to court documents, Ramirez didn't answer the regulator's questions because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution. He also asserted his constitutional right to remain silent in the legal proceedings for the SEC's civil case.     Breaking silence   Ramirez finally broke his silence this past Saturday when he named seven individuals, he alleges were either involved in, had knowledge of, or encouraged the transactions of the scheme.  In his sentencing memorandum, Ramirez singled-out: Doel Garcia, a UBS executive, Ramiro Colon, a UBS Puerto Rico branch manager and his former supervisor, Carlos Ubinas, the chairman and president of UBS Puerto Rico, as well as four current or former UBS Puerto Rico brokers: David Lugo, Fernando Castillo, Leslie Highley and Luis Sanchez.  In response to these allegations, a spokesman from UBS said: ""In its sentencing papers, the DOJ described Mr. Ramirez's offense as 'brazen', found that he took various steps to 'circumvent' UBS controls and to 'obscure' from UBS what he was doing, and found that Mr. Ramirez 'took advantage of all parties involved.' In light of these findings, Mr. Ramirez's last-ditch efforts to blame his victims for his own criminal conduct should be seen for what it is: an attempt to escape responsibility for his own wrongdoing.""  CNBC reached out to lawyers or representatives of these individuals.  Cory Jacobs, the trial attorney for the U.S. government, ""flatly objected"" to the assertion that Ramirez was made a ""scapegoat"" for the scheme.  ""UBS did an internal investigation that identified the defendant as the hub of the fraud,"" Jacobs told Judge Hogan. He also said that people would go into UBS and ask for ""the whopper special.""  Jacobs told the Judge that Ramirez had cooperated with the government during its investigation, but that the evidence and information he provided wasn't enough for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that other bankers were knowingly engaged in the fraudulent conduct.  UBS added in its statement to CNBC, ""UBS refutes any insinuation of wrongdoing by any of the people he has tried to implicate.""  A lawyer for Lugo said, ""Mr Lugo did not engage in the activities for which Mr. Ramirez was charged, and to which Mr. Ramirez pled guilty. Nor was Mr. Lugo ever even charged with conducting such activity. Mr. Lugo's employment arbitration against UBS-PR was settled to the satisfaction of both UBS-PR and Mr. Lugo.""  UBS has previously settled with FINRA and the SEC for roughly $34 million for charges involving the sales practices of the bond funds and failure to supervise.  UBS has also paid out nearly $480 million to clients in FINRA settlements and awards as of January, with over 800 cases against UBS Puerto Rico still pending, according to data compiled by SLCG.  In addition, the Swiss bank has disclosed in regulatory filings an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice into the impermissible reinvestment of loan proceeds, in regard to the Puerto Rico funds. UBS says they are cooperating with the authorities.

They reported an engine problem, unrelated to issues that prompted the FAA to ground the planes, the agency says. No passengers were aboard the plane. Southwest is ferrying the planes for storage in California.      Leslie Josephs | @lesliejosephs   Published 5 Hours Ago  Updated  3 Hours Ago  CNBC.com                show chapters               Southwest Boeing 737 Max flight makes emergency landing following engine issue   4 Hours Ago |  01:23        The crew of a Southwest Airlines  Boeing 737 Max declared an emergency shortly after takeoff and returned to Orlando's main airport on Tuesday after reporting an engine problem, the Federal Aviation Administration said.   The FAA grounded this type of aircraft earlier this month following two fatal crashes of the popular model.  Airlines aren't allowed to fly passengers under the FAA's order. The Southwest plane, which was not carrying passengers, was bound for Victorville, Calif., where the carrier is storing the aircraft in a facility in the western Mojave Desert.   The FAA on March 13 joined dozens of other countries in grounding the planes, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing 737 Max 8. All 157 passengers on board were killed and investigators said the crash had ""clear similarities"" with a Lion Air flight in October, operated by the same type of plane, plunged into the Java Sea in Indonesia, killing the 189 people on board.  The FAA said it is investigating the Southwest incident on Tuesday and that the issue was not related to other concerns about the 737 Max that led the agency to ground the plane.  Southwest Flight 8701, the ferry flight, returned to Orlando International Airport shortly before 3 p.m. EDT after the pilots ""reported a performance issue with one of the engines shortly after takeoff,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""The crew followed protocol and safely landed back at the airport.""  A Southwest spokesman said the plane did not experience any issues with control, such as the controversial automated anti-stall system Boeing added to the planes before their debut in 2017.  Investigators in the Lion Air crash suspect that pilots were battling the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, which automatically pushes the nose of the plane down to avoid a stall. That can be catastrophic if the plane's sensor erroneously signals to the plane that it is in a stall when it is not.  Boeing has tweaked the system, which was tested by pilots over the weekend in Renton, Wash., where the company assembles the plane. The changes include using data from two sensors instead of one and limiting the number of nose-down positions the plane will take if the system is engaged.  Pilots received a short computer course before transitioning to the Max from older 737s and said they did not know the MCAS system existed until after the Lion Air crash.  Boeing submitted its certification plan for the software update to the FAA in January and conducted a test flight with new software along with the FAA on March 12. That flight showed the 737 Max with the new software ""still meets certification requirements,"" a company official said Tuesday.  — CNBC's  Phil LeBeau  contributed to this report.

Here's why pearls are so expensive.        Alyssa Pagano and Rob Ludacer  5h                                                                 The most expensive natural pearl ever sold was Marie Antoinette's pendant . It went for $32 million in a 2018 Sotheby's auction. Celebrities like Rihanna , Uma Thurman , and Cardi B all adorned themselves in pearls for last year's Met Gala . Pearls come in many different colors and sizes, and these variables help determine their value. Following is a transcription of the video. Narrator: Pearls have been a symbol of elegance and class for centuries. The Maharajas of India and European queens adorned themselves with pearls, a symbol of their prestige. At 2018's Catholic Church-inspired Met Gala, celebrities walked the red carpet dripping in pearls. Uma Thurman's dress had over 3,000 white pearls sewn to it, while Rihanna's pope-inspired outfit was encrusted in pearls. At the 2019 Grammys, Cardi B was basically dressed like an oyster. The most expensive pearl ever sold was Marie Antoinette's pendant. It sold for $32 million in a 2018 auction. But what is it that makes pearls so expensive? Marie Antoinette's pearl was part of a diamond-studded pendant, and it has important historical significance, which increased its value. But there are several other factors that determine the value of a pearl. Tom Moses: Assessing the value of a pearl is probably the most complex gem to assess. Narrator: That's Tom Moses. He's a gemologist at the Gemological Institute of America where he oversees diamond grading, colored stone identification, and pearl identification. He says that part of the reason the Marie Antoinette pearl is worth so much is because it's a natural pearl, which brings us to one quality that determines a pearl's value. Natural versus cultured. Natural pearls are hard to find. They're rare, and this makes them worth more money. But let's rewind for a second. What is a natural pearl, and how are they formed? Natural pearls form when some kind of irritant, usually a small organism, makes its way into the shell of a mollusk like an oyster or a mussel. To protect itself from the invader, the mollusk starts to coat the debris with nacre, or mother-of-pearl, the same material that lines the inner layer of its shell. It continues doing this, and the irritant grows into a shiny pearl. Cultured pearls are formed by the same process, but instead of the irritant entering the shell accidentally, it's put there intentionally by a human. Pearl farmers insert a piece of mollusk tissue, which is called donor tissue, into the shell of the oyster where they want the pearl to grow. This triggers the oyster's defense response, and it starts coating that piece of tissue with nacre. The vast majority of pearls on the market are cultured pearls. The Gemological Institute of America uses X-rays to tell if a pearl is natural or cultured. If you look closely at these two images, you can see the difference. Moses: Think about the layers of an onion. So a natural pearl would have all of those concentric layers of growth from the very inside out. Narrator: A cultured pearl, on the other hand, is like an orange, with a large center and a thinner layer of pearl growth around that. The large center is the manmade irritant placed in the shell to encourage nacre formation. Cultured pearls date all the way back to around 500 AD in China. However, in 1893, the Japanese-born Kōkichi Mikimoto streamlined the process and eventually created perfectly round pearls. Today, Mikimoto is widely considered the grandfather of cultured pearls. He used Akoya pearls, which are the traditional white round pearls you're probably familiar with. By the 1920s, cultured pearls became more commercially available, which made them more affordable and accessible to people who weren't royalty. But just because you can grow a cultured pearl doesn't mean it's an easy process. Pearl farmers pry open the mollusk shell just enough to implant the piece of foreign tissue, then they put the oysters back in the water and wait anywhere from six months to two years for pearls to form, and not every pearl comes out the same, which brings us to another quality that can make one pearl worth more than another. Size. Moses: The larger the pearl, the more valuable, just like any other gem. Narrator: The size of the pearl largely depends on the size of the mollusk. Certain oysters grow bigger than others and can, therefore, make bigger pearls. For example, Akoya pearls can only grow to about 9 or 10 millimeters in diameter, but South Sea pearls and black Tahitian pearls can reach a diameter of around 15 or 16 millimeters. The larger size makes South Sea pearls and black pearls the most valuable type of pearl. On Mikimoto's website, this strand of South Sea cultured pearls is selling for $32,000. The other notable difference between pearl types is the color. Sometimes this goes hand in hand with size because the pearl's color is determined mostly by the mollusk it comes from. Tahitian black pearls are black because the inside of the Pinctada margaritifera oyster is black, but colors can vary slightly based on the culturing process as well. Moses: The main reason for the color difference is the species of the mollusk. Another very interesting influence is when a pearl is cultured, there is a donor tissue used from another living mollusk, and depending on the color of that tissue, it will influence the color of the final cultured pearl. Narrator: Take for example Akoya pearls. These are all white pearls, but the shade of white can still vary. Some strands might be slightly more pink, while others have more of a greenish tint. Tom says that pinker pearls are typically preferred over green hues. Along with size and color, the shape and surface of a pearl can have an impact on its value. Typically the rounder and smoother, the better. And finally, perhaps the hardest variable to measure: luster. Luster is essentially the way a pearl reflects light. The shinier the pearl, the better. But it's hard to tell how shiny a pearl is unless you have other pearls to compare it to. That's why Tom and the rest of the Gemological Institute have a collection of sample strands for comparison. That way they can look at how one strand of pearls compares to another and see where it falls on the luster scale. The quality of a pearl's luster is influenced by the layers of nacre that coat the center. One way to think of it is like the tiles of a roof. Picture a roof with all the tiles lined up so that everything fits together well. If you translate that to a pearl, it would result in a nice, high-luster pearl. A dull, low-luster pearl would be more like a roof with broken and fragmented tiles that don't line up. When you take into consideration all of these factors, finding or creating the perfect pearl is an art, and the fact remains they're grown inside an animal, so it's impossible to have complete control over how and when they form, especially in the wild. So if you ever bite down on something hard while you're eating an oyster, take a look at it before you chuck it. It might be more than a piece of sand.

Brian Schwartz | @schwartzbCNBC   Published 3 Hours Ago  Updated  16 Mins Ago  CNBC.com              Callaghan O'Hare | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and 2020 presidential candidate, pauses during the South By Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, U.S., on Saturday, March 9, 2019.   Mayor and 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg is making inroads into the New York donor circuit as he prepares to attend a campaign fundraiser hosted by Broadway executive Jordan Roth.   Roth, and his husband, Richie Jackson, who is a movie producer, will be holding a reception for the South Bend, Indiana mayor with suggested contributions from $250 to $2,800, according to an invite first obtained by CNBC .  Roth is the president and majority owner of Jujacmyn Theaters, which has presented a litany of award-winning Broadway shows including ""The Book of Mormon"" and ""Springsteen on Broadway."" He's also the son of billionaire and real estate titan Steven Roth, who, according Forbes, has a net-worth of $1.1 billion.   The elder Roth, however, is a staunch supporter of Republican causes. He recently invested $100,000 into President Donald Trump's joint fundraising committee, Trump Victory and the same amount toward former House Speaker Paul Ryan's organization, Team Ryan.  For Buttigieg, an openly gay candidate for president and Afghanistan War veteran, the fundraiser represents a sign that he is making traction with donors and voters alike.  In a recent Emerson poll, the South Bend mayor picked up 11 percent of the vote in the early caucus state of Iowa. Nationally, Buttigieg has totaled 2 percent of the vote from Democratic primary voters, according to data compiled by Morning Consult. Notably, Buttigieg tied in that same poll with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.  A spokeswoman for Buttigieg did not return a request for comment. Roth did not return an email seeking comment.

AP Photo/Jae C. Hong          A judge will hear oral arguments on whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk is in contempt of a Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on April 4. Musk's contempt charge is related to a tweet he sent falsely claiming that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2019. The company has estimated it would make about 400,000 in public filings. Musk got in trouble for making false statements on Twitter last year, when he said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private for $420 per share. He, in reality, did not have funding secured. On April 4, Elon Musk's lawyers (and perhaps Musk himself) will appear for oral arguments in New York City to counter the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) claim that Musk is in contempt of a ruling meant to prevent him from making false statements on Twitter. This latest salvo between the Tesla CEO and the SEC started in February, when Musk tweeted that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2019. The company has said in public filings that it would make about 400,000. To the SEC, this incorrect tweet was a violation of a ruling it made against Musk last year, in which it accused Musk of falsely claiming he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share in August. That tweet to his powerful 20 million-person Twitter following that allegedly spread false material information forced Musk to step down as Chairman of Tesla's board. Musk and Tesla were each fined $20 million. On top of that, Musk had to appoint a Twitter czar to review tweets containing information material to Tesla's future. Adults don't need a Twitter sitter A day after Musk tweeted that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2019, his chief legal counsel (who had been at Tesla for two months) quit. A few days later, the SEC demanded that Musk prove that he was not in contempt of court. To bolster the charge that he was, the SEC not only went back to the tweet but also to an interview Musk did with ""60 Minutes,"" during which he said there was no Twitter czar at Tesla and some ""mistakes"" may be made. Musk responded to the SEC by saying that it was attempting to expand on the terms of its settlement by limiting his speech on Twitter and that, in doing so, it was seeking to violate his First Amendment rights. Musk also said that he has ""diligently attempted to comply"" with the SEC and that the SEC's use of Musk's comments made during a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview as proof of his violation reflected a ""concerning and unprecedented overreach on the part of the SEC.""

On Friday, the spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasury notes dipped below 10 basis points for the first time since 2007, indicating an inverted yield curve — when short-term yields rise above longer-term yields.  To many, an inverted yield curve signals an oncoming recession. But analysts and economists are largely split — and mostly underwhelmed — by the latest test of the market's resilience.   Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey, for one, said the significance of the inversion will depend on how long it lasts:  ""The importance of the yield curve is how long are we going to be inverted for? [...] The longer you have this situation, the higher the risk goes. I think if we can go a few days inverted and then start to steepen again, I don't think the concerns are as worrisome. ... Our big area of focus is the semiconductors, and they've been a great leadership [group] for the market overall over the last six years. Every major sell-off in the stock market has been preceded by underperformance.""  James Camp, Eagle Asset Management's managing director of strategic income, was more bearish:  ""The issue for the equity market is the bond market telling you that global growth has really rolled over in a material sense, and we think that's likely. We also think that the problems in Europe … [are] indicative of what's happening in the bunds market. We now have negative yields back in Germany, so their 10-year now is back to that negative territory that had us all spooked just a couple of years ago. So I think the yield curve is signaling slowdown, no inflation, and that risk asset prices are vulnerable. [...] I think the bond market's basically telling you, 'Look, the next move is lower, not higher, on short-term rates.'""  Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, was not convinced that a recession is in store:  ""When something happens for the first time since 2007, people pay attention, and that's what happened on Friday when you got the inversion. However, when you look at the economy ... and also when you look at the determinants of the yield curve shape and move, this is not signaling recession. This is signaling some very peculiar technicals in the market that have to do with what's happening in Europe, that have to do with what's happening in the Fed, rather than what's happening in the economy. This economy, unless it gets disrupted by a major policy mistake, is on its way to 2.5 to 3 percent growth for this year. [...] This is a strong labor market. We continue to have average monthly job creation well above what you would expect at this time of the cycle. You're having real wage growth, and people are coming back into the labor market. Business investment is picking up; that's good news for this year and next year. And, yes, the effects of the tax cuts are eroding, but against that, government spending is increasing. So, put it all together: this still has momentum. This economy still has momentum for this year. There's no way you're going to get a recession.""  Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global Research's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, noted that the market typically sees 12 months of gains following an inversion, and that creates opportunity:  ""The Fed's tone has shifted so aggressively to a dovish stance that I think the real opportunity today is in consumer discretionary stocks. In fact, we just upgraded the sector from underweight to overweight, ... and what's interesting is that consumer discretionary has been left for dead. And what I mean is the average mutual fund has a lower weight exposure in consumer discretionary stocks than they have since the financial crisis. [...] Normally, this late in the cycle, the U.S. consumer would look very different, but this time around, consumers haven't taken on as much leverage. Again, if you look at all of the balance sheet measures for consumers, they look really unusually healthy at this point relative to where they ought to be given how much the government has tried to encourage us to take on more and more debt.""  Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, made an even bolder call:  ""I know the yield curve's inverted, but the front end is like Chicken Little. It has inverted as early as four years before a recession. The real curve to watch is the 10-Year/30-Year , and that's been steepening. So it might be too early for people to get neutral. And then we did a report last week to show that there's a lot of indicators that show we're mid-cycle in the U.S. [...] I think it's contrarian to say we're mid-cycle, but if you look at [the] employment-to-population [ratio], usually, it peaks at 64 percent. That's 10 million more jobs, or about 300,000 a year for three more years.""

Analysis of 700,000 naturalist records going back to 1980 has found that about 33 per cent of 353 species studied declined in the extent of their range across the island. Losses worsened in wild bees after 2007, four years after the introduction of a group of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which have since been almost entirely banned by the EU. The assessment found that the key group of 22 wild bees and hoverflies behind crop pollination had been doing relatively well. Overall, 11 per cent of the species studied increased their range between 1980 and 2013.   Advertisement       That is no reason for complacency though, says Gary Powney of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who was involved in the work. “It’s a risky pollination strategy to rely on just 22 species.” While not immediate cause for alarm in terms of food production, the shrinking of many species’ range is a concern for a loss of richness in nature. The geographic range of the common carder bee increased by 82 per cent between 1980 and 2013 Lucy Hulmes “The widespread common species, in very broad terms, are doing okay. The rarer species are doing less well. If you only care about wildlife and biodiversity, it’s bad news. If you only care about whether your crops are being pollinated, it’s okay,” says Nick Isaac, who also worked on the research at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The once widespread red-shanked carder bee ( Bombus ruderarius ) is among the losers, down 42 per cent. By contrast, the ashy mining bee ( Andrena cineraria) increased its range fivefold. Farming, habitat loss and pesticide use have all been blamed for insect losses in recent years. Key crop pollinators could be doing well because of a sevenfold increase in land given over to oilseed rape since 1980, and more strips of wildflowers in farm fields, experts say.

Emily Bailes of Royal Holloway, University of London, says the research suggests that agricultural environment schemes are having a positive impact. However, she foresees new threats: “I see climate change as an increasing issue for pollinators in the future, alongside habitat loss from urban development.” Journal reference: Nature Communications , DOI: 10.1038/s41467-019-08974-9 More on these topics: biodiversity    Advertisement      Trending  Latest  Video  Free      We may finally know what causes Alzheimer’s – and how to stop it    Huge T. rex fossil suggests many dinosaurs were bigger than we thought    Dogs really can smell your fear, and then they get scared too    Schrödinger’s kittens: New thought experiment breaks quantum theory    We’ve found 4000 exoplanets but almost zero are right for life        All the info our brain needs for language nearly fits on a floppy disk    We've discovered a massive dinosaur-era river delta under the sea    AIs go up against animals in an epic competition to test intelligence    The US wants to send astronauts to the moon’s south pole in 2024    Smog may be getting worse in some cities thanks to Arctic warming        I want to believe: An astronomer's view of aliens    What do you do with the world's most powerful laser?

Daniel Aleksandersen,technology,"        Ctrl  blog      Topics  Archives  Follow  Tip jar  About  Search       Advertisement                Aren’t AMP Caches committing copyright infringement?     Daniel Aleksandersen    Published: 2019-03-26      Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are specially formatted web pages that companies like Cloudflare, Google, and Microsoft copy off publishers’ websites and make available through their own AMP Cache web servers. There is no redistribution license agreement between the AMP Caches and the publishers, so how come AMP Caches aren’t considered copyright infringement on a massive scale?   Like the name suggest, albeit heavily disputed, the purpose of AMP is to speed up webpage delivery time and performance on high-latency mobile devices. Web publishers can either choose to specifically create AMP-formatted web pages in addition or instead of their regular web pages. Some publishing platform may create AMP variants alongside the regular web page without the knowledge of the author (the copyright holder).  Both Microsoft Bing and Google Search will auto-discover an AMP-variant of a document and link to it in their own AMP Caches instead of linking to the regular web pages on their search result pages when searching from a mobile device.  This whole process got me real curios about how this process could possibly be legal under copyright laws. Google and Microsoft are making and distributing pages, images, and other assets on a massive scale for creative works that they haven’t been expressly licensed to redistribute.   Disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer and this isn’t legal advice. This article consists of my interpretation of the copyright laws of Australia, Canada, EU, and USA and is intended for entertainment purposes.   Google have always presented AMP as a performance enhancing caching service. Normally, a transparent caching proxy service would sit somewhere in the network path between the end user and the original web server. This service has typically been deployed by internet service providers (ISPs) to cut the costs associated with connecting outside their own networks.   Exceptions for caching in copyright law  Your devices don’t redownload the site logo and other shared resources when you go from one page on a website to another. Instead, your web browser caches recently and frequently used resources like images and scripts on your device so you don’t need to go back and forth with the web server for every page you want to load.   Advertisement    In the early 2000s, copyright laws around the world were amended specifically to grant an exception for this type of transient but cost- and performance essential copying of otherwise protected creative works.  The caching exception was also extended to shared caches, like a transparent proxy cache operated by an internet service provider at the edge of their networks, that automatically cached resources on behalf of and redistributed them to many users and redistributed these files.  AMP Caches aren’t part of the normal networking path between the website publisher and the user so they’re not doing the traditional intermediary caching that network operators have done in the past. Instead, AMP Caches represent an entirely separate location where users get a copy of the cached content.  I don’t believe it was ever the intention of any lawmaker to allow for or grant the broad safe-harbor provisions allowed for by copyright laws to a service like an AMP Cache. In my understanding, lawmakers tried to grant very specific exceptions for intermediary caches but made the provisions too broad when they attempted to also make it technology neutral.    Requirements for caching safe harbor provisions  Caches and caches are vaguely defined in copyright laws. However; Australian, Canadian, European Union, and USA laws agree that the caching process must be automatic and that the caches must follow industry standards for removing and updating cached materials. AMP Caches satisfies this requirement by supporting the industry standard HTTP Cache-Control header and other related caching headers.  EU law also requires that the caching must only be done for the purpose of making communications more efficient; which is how Google have presented AMP all along.  Copyright laws require that no modifications are made to the cached creative works. Australian and Canadian copyright laws specifically grants exceptions to this requirement for changes made by an undefined technical processes. EU and USA copyright laws have no such exceptions.  AMP Caches makes a few notable optimizations and modifications to cached content . These changes performed by the AMP Caches are done to achieve high performance but it may also be stripping away their safe harbor provisions as allowed for under EU and USA copyright laws.    The implied license  An implied license in the context of copyright law is a license granted by a rights holder in the absence of an expressly written contract.  You really need to be a copyright lawyer to make any sense of the finer details of implied licenses. Most resources on implied licenses that I found on the web consists of little more than lawyers shaking their heads at the lack of an expressly written legal agreement in their place.  For the most parts, authors and publishers themselves have opted to produce AMP formatted pages with the implicit understanding that their creative works will end up in one or more AMP Caches operated by one or more companies. In knowingly doing so, they’re also supposedly granting permission for AMP Cache providers to copy and redistribute their creative works.  As a I’ve mentioned earlier, this may not always be the case as some content management systems produce AMP formatted pages automatically without the knowledge of the rights holder. Not every party will be aware of nor happy with the arrangement.

When you hear a word you know, your brain is accessing all kinds of information to help you make sense of it: the sounds that make up the word, the meanings it has, its context in a sentence, the tense of a verb, and more.   Advertisement       Mollica and his colleagues used a branch of mathematics called information theory to figure out how many bits of data you’d need to encode all of this to lean English. These are estimates, Mollica says, but they give us a ballpark idea that can quantify how much information language acquisition requires. They started with phonemes – the distinct sounds that make up words. There are around 50 phonemes in English and each require 15 bits, so phonemes alone require about 750 bits.  Read more: Humans couldn’t pronounce ‘f’ and ‘v’ sounds before farming developed  We also need to learn to say individual words. The team found that learning the average English vocabulary size of 40,000 words requires about 400,000 bits. Understanding the meaning of those words requires yet more bits, because words contain a lot of information. “It’s lexical semantics, which is the full meaning of a word. If I say ‘turkey’ to you, there’s information you know about a turkey. You can answer whether or not it can fly, whether it can walk,” Mollica says. All that requires about 12 million bits for 40,000 words. Knowing how often certain words appear is also important during language learning, and storing this word frequency information takes about 80,000 bits. Finally, syntax – the set of rules that govern sentences – requires the least, clocking in at around 700 bits. Add that all together and you get 1.56 megabytes – slightly more than the capacity of a floppy disk. Mollica says that while these numbers only apply to English, they are broad enough estimates that they might carry over to other languages.
